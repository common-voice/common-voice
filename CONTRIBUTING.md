- [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)

#### Local Development
If you haven't already, install the latest version of NodeJS and npm: https://nodejs.org/en/download/; and yarn: https://yarnpkg.com/en/

Then enter the following commands:

2. Build and serve files located in the `web` folder on localhost.
3. Save uploaded voice clips onto Amazon's S3.
