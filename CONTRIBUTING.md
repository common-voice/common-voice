### Bug Fixes and Feature Enhancements
All of our current issues can be found here on GitHub. Anything with a [help wanted](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) tag is up for grabs.

#### Requirements
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v7 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (4 or higher)
- [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)

#### Local Development
If you haven't already, install the latest version of NodeJS and npm: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Then enter the following commands:
```
npm install
npm install -g gulp
gulp
```
This will:
1. Install all JavaScript dependencies.
2. Build and serve files located in the `web` folder on localhost.
3. Save uploaded voice clips onto Amazon's S3.
4. Lint and rebuild all js files on every change.

#### Project Directory Structure
The project is organized into the following directories:

- *android*: The Android app, simple webview wrapper of voice.mozilla.org. This app is not currently published.
- *docs*: Design and data specifications for Common Voice.
- *ios*: The iOS app. At the time of it's publishing, this was a workaround for Safari not supporting getUserMedia.
- *nubis*: Configuration files for [Nubis](https://github.com/nubisproject), our deployment tool.
- *server*: The server-side code app logic written in NodeJS.
- *tools*: Just some scripts for managing data.
- *web*: The Common Voice website files.

#### Before Opening a Pull Request
When you're done with some code changes that you want to submit, please ensure the following before opening your Pull Request (PR):
1. All code passes linting (`gulp lint` finishes without errors or warnings).
2. All code compiles (`gulp ts ts-server` finishes without errors or warnings).
