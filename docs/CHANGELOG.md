### [v1.148.0 (2025-07-21)](https://github.com/common-voice/common-voice/releases/tag/release-v1.148.0)

- Feat: Change clip-upload process to handle remaining duplicate-clip errors. In the existing implementation, if there is a duplicate, each upload was giving a separate error, and the error message was generic. It also provided a "retry" option which resulted in the same problem. With this change, the problem will only be provided once at the end, providing only a "continue" option.

- Fix: Long (3h) lock duration in LazyCache implementation was preventing more frequent updates in Redis caching. This fix adds lock-duration as a parameter, per query, with a default of 3 min if not specified. By [@moz-bozden](https://github.com/moz-bozden) in [#4949](https://github.com/common-voice/common-voice/pull/4949)
- Fix: Non existing locale in migration should not throw error but silently warn, it causes local dev env fail if that language does not exist - update to [#4559](https://github.com/common-voice/common-voice/pull/4959) by [@moz-bozden](https://github.com/moz-bozden) in [#4974](https://github.com/common-voice/common-voice/pull/4974) thank you [@akrabat](https://github.com/akrabat) for reporting and testing.
