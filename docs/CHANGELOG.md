## Current release

### [v1.148.0 (2025-07-21)](https://github.com/common-voice/common-voice/releases/tag/release-v1.148.0)

- Feat: Change clip-upload process to handle remaining duplicate-clip errors. In the existing implementation, if there is a duplicate, each upload was giving a separate error, and the error message was generic. It also provided a "retry" option which resulted in the same problem. With this change, the problem will only be provided once at the end, providing only a "continue" option. By [@moz-bozden](https://github.com/moz-bozden) in [#4950](https://github.com/common-voice/common-voice/pull/4950)
- Feat: First implementation of LazySetCache class, currently not connected to application code. General purpose Redis caching of objects in current LazyCache module is too costly for simple caching of numbers and strings. By [@moz-bozden](https://github.com/moz-bozden) in [#4950](https://github.com/common-voice/common-voice/pull/4950)
- Feat: Add common-voice-network Docker network to enable communication between services (Scripted Speech, Spontaneous Speech, Public API, ...) by [@akrabat](https://github.com/akrabat) in [#4982](https://github.com/common-voice/common-voice/pull/4982)
- Feat (Public API): Create additional tests for Public API credentials by [@akrabat](https://github.com/akrabat) in [#4981](https://github.com/common-voice/common-voice/pull/4981)
- Feat (Public API): Create endpoint to create client credentials by [@moz-dfeller](https://github.com/moz-dfeller) and [@akrabat](https://github.com/akrabat) in [#4971](https://github.com/common-voice/common-voice/pull/4971)
- Workaround: Some users were having a caching related issue after the parameter passing change in [#4945](https://github.com/common-voice/common-voice/pull/4945). Implemented a workaround to handle both cases for a while by [@moz-bozden](https://github.com/moz-bozden) in [#4975](https://github.com/common-voice/common-voice/pull/4975)
- Fix: Long (3h) lock duration in LazyCache implementation was preventing more frequent updates in Redis caching. This fix adds lock-duration as a parameter, per query, with a default of 3 min if not specified. By [@moz-bozden](https://github.com/moz-bozden) in [#4949](https://github.com/common-voice/common-voice/pull/4949)
- Fix: Non existing locale in migration should not throw error but silently warn, it causes local dev env fail if that language does not exist - update to [#4559](https://github.com/common-voice/common-voice/pull/4959) by [@moz-bozden](https://github.com/moz-bozden) in [#4974](https://github.com/common-voice/common-voice/pull/4974) thank you [@akrabat](https://github.com/akrabat) for reporting and testing.
- (in v1.147.1) Fix: Parameter passing with fields containing underscore through request.headers were causing problems in some external environments (e.g. nginx) by [@moz-bozden](https://github.com/moz-bozden) in [#4945](https://github.com/common-voice/common-voice/pull/4945)
- Docs: Update `.env-local-docker.example` and `DEVELOPMENT.md` to include more comments for developers, especially on the use of authentication - with error checking, by [@moz-kathyreid](https://github.com/moz-kathyreid) in [#4980](https://github.com/common-voice/common-voice/pull/4980)
- Chore: Updates to Pontoon keys
