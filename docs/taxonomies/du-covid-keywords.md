## Segment: Kinyarwandan COVID-19 phrases

This set of 31 words and phrases in Kinyarwanda relate to COVID-19. The phrases will be used to create a voice-based information system to convey up-to-date news to citizens of Rwanda. Mozilla is collaborating with Digital Umuganda and GIZ in order to bring this useful technology to life in an impactful way. Speakers of Kinyarwanda will be able to telephone a free government service and ask for updates on COVID information and Rwandan policies on related matters such as travel, lockdown, and curfew.

### What's a target segment?

As the Common Voice project grows in dataset size, community, and reach, it has become increasingly important for the platform to be able to distinguish the context of its collected data. Providing context, or a vocabulary of what the data relates to via tagging, allows for a more complete picture beyond language, accent, sex and age. This level of detail will allow contributors — both community members submitting recordings and sentences, as well as researchers and developers analyzing the final output — to select the segment that is the most relevant to them. This will enable more detailed feedback on how to continue improving the dataset, while also unlocking more possibilities for usefulness and application.
