## Segment: Singleword Benchmark

This target segment consists of the the digits zero through nine, as well as the words yes, no, hey and Firefox. Please refer to [this Discourse post for more details](https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/help-create-common-voices-first-target-segment/59587).

### What's a target segment?

As the Common Voice project grows in dataset size, community, and reach, it has become increasingly important for the platform to be able to distinguish the context of its collected data. Providing context, or a vocabulary of what the data relates to via tagging, allows for a more complete picture beyond language, accent, sex and age. This level of detail will allow contributors — both community members submitting recordings and sentences, as well as researchers and developers analyzing the final output — to select the segment that is the most relevant to them. This will enable more detailed feedback on how to continue improving the dataset, while also unlocking more possibilities for usefulness and application.
