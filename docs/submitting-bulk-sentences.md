All the sentences read by our contributors are sourced from copyright free sources or permissioned sources, either through [automated sourcing](https://github.com/common-voice/cv-sentence-extractor) by agreement from sources like Wikipedia or contributed by our language communities.

If you want to add a single sentence, or a series of single sentences, you can do so via the [Sentence Collection](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/write) page on the [Common Voice website](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org). To contribute a larger number of sentences at once, you can use the Bulk Sentence upload option.

Remember that for both single sentence and bulk sentence submissions, sentences must:
- Be in the public domain, with a CC0 license
- Be short, readable and take about 10-15 seconds to read
- Avoid including numbers or special characters
## Formatting Your Bulk Sentences
To upload bulk sentences, you'll need to have created a TSV file with your sentences.

Please format your bulk sentences into a [.TSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values) file with five columns, containing the following columns from left to right:
- Your sentence
- The source for your sentence
- Additional infomation about why this source is eligible for inclusion in a CC0 dataset
- A blank column for our team to use in the quality control process
- An optional column showing the domain for sentences, as described in [this blog post](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/domain-datasets-common-voice/)

The more information you are able to provide in the Source column, the easier it will be to get your bulk sentence submission validated.

Here is an example of a formatted bulk sentence submission of English sentences:

## After Submitting Your Bulk Sentences

Once your file has been sent, our team will quality control the bulk sentence submission by asking a community member from the same language community to evaluate a randomly selected sample of sentences from your file. After quality control checks have been passed, our engineers with merge your approved bulk setences file into the text corpus for the appropriate language. If we have questions or concerns with your bulk sentence sumission, our team will contact you to discuss them.

There is currently a backlog for bulk sentence review, so there may be a short wait for your sentence to be processed.
