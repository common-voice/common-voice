# Language

Common Voice is always growing, and we welcome all new languages. There are two components to adding a new language to Common Voice:

- Make sure it is localized
- Make sure there are sufficient sentences to read

These two things can occur simultaneously

## Localization

In order for a new language to be activated on Common Voice, it must be at least 90% localized in that given language.

We use the [Mozilla localization platform Pontoon](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/projects/common-voice/) to handle translations of the web interface. Use the project page to find your language community and help submit new translations.

For more information on how Common Voice approaches language and accents, please refer to our [language and accent strategy](https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/common-voice-languages-and-accent-strategy-v5/56555).

If your language is not available for translation on Pontoon, you can request for it to be added by submitting a new issue using the [language requests template](https://github.com/mozilla/common-voice/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=language_request.md&title=).

## Sentences

In order for a new language to be contributable on Common Voice, it must have at least 5,000 sentences available to be read. This is so we can ensure a diverse and balanced dataset and so that there isn't unnecessary repetition of the same phrases.

Please refer to [SENTENCES.md](./SENTENCES.md) for more information on how to contribute sentences.

## Status

To see the current progress of a language, please refer to the [language stats](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/languages) page on the website.
