//    add select only those who has positive points.
// 3) be careful in deciding where to put the filtering conditions: in LEFT JOIN or in WHERE, big differences,
//    most of the conditions are in LEFT JOIN to avoid missing the necessary rows when null occurs on optional columns.
// 4) some of the conditions are probably over-thinking.
