/*
 * CV relies on Pontoon for translations, language statistics and metadata. As a result, when determining the launch vs in-progress status
 * of a language, CV uses the statistics to see if a language should be launched.
 *
 * Currently, CV only fetches Pontoon data on startup (that is, every time the node application starts aka once when deployed, or if the application is restarted)
 * which is not guaranteed to occur in a timely manner. As a result, languages can be held up being promoted and ultimately slows contributions for new languages.
 *
 * Thus, by creating a scheduled job which can query Pontoon and update language metadata, languages will not be subject to the unpredictable deploy cycles and
 * accept contributions much sooner to the actual
 *
 * In order for a language to be launched (and start collecting clips), it must meet two distinct criteria:
 *  - website text has at least 60% translations
 *  - sentence contributions meets or exceeds predetermined sentence target
 *
 * Once a language has met the two criterion, it is launched (the flag "is_contributable" is set to true the database).
