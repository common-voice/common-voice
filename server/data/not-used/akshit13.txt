How are you?
This looks amazing!
Where have you been for so long?
Are you coming tomorrow?
Life is beautiful.
Do you need any help?
I like ice-cream.
I believe in you.
It starts with one thing.
Let's meet tomorrow.
Do you like cooking?
She looks so gorgeous today.
I'm going out with her toning.
Programming requires brains.
Nice to meet you.
That party was amazing.
What time is it?
I need a break.
I am in a good mood right now.
She likes you.
We should meet some day.
The road is blocked.
We need to run.
They say this is not good.
We need to hurry.
Weekends are always fun.
We need to solve this problem fast.
I need some coffee.
Do you like her?
She knows everything.
That can't be true.
I need to buy a new phone.
How old are you?
I like the way she talks.
We need to talk.
You need to see this.
You are the best.
Let's dance.
I will be back soon.
Please don't cry.
I'm loving it.
How are you doing today?
What a lovely day!
Tomorrow is another day.
Never give up.
Keep trying hard.
Turn up the volume.
Can we talk tomorrow?
Try it again.
You can do this.
Just one more try.
All the best.
