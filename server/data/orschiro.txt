I looked outside the window and saw the basil.
She sat on the floor drinking her coffee.
It was early morning when she woke up.
They heard the people walking on the street.
It wasn't clear to him how to spend his morning time.
We were awaiting the guitar player to begin the concert.
The coffee had a very strong taste.
The sun was very hot this summer.
It was hard for him to eat less because the food was so good.
It took the bus 24 hours to reach the destination.
She was waiting for her response.
It took him a while to get to the office.
They were suffering from hunger.
Next time, we are going to do it differently.
She loves to get up early.
Will you trust him that he does it right?
It was very hard for her to focus.
The guitar broke and she couldn't play anymore.
The poor boy stood in the rain.
They all left home and flew to Mars.
We used all your imagination to design the place.
Whenever we wanted, we could see him.
She improved her list every day.
It took her a while to get used to it.
How often do you want to eat?
The beer tasted really good.
They met with a bunch of people in the pub.
The man preferred basil over parsley.
He didn't mind the extra work.
They worked from early morning till late evening.
He enjoyed the water in his cup.
The phone rang while she was awake.
They all met during office hours.
What if you can't stand him?
Sun is better than rain.
The beach looked so beautifully.
We are big fans of our football club.
Every time he saw her, he felt nervous.
It didn't change anything.
It took some time for him to fully wake up.
All ways led to the same destination.
He preferred to sit down and wait.
They enjoyed the silence.
There was hardly anyone there.
The space quickly filled with people.
Upon arrival, the train was waiting for all passengers.
The water was crystal clear.
We wiped the board.
The arrow was pointing to the exit.
He found the toilet occupied.
