Today I’m making the Internet more inclusive.
The Internet should reflect all of the people who use it.
The Internet should put the power in the hands of the many.
Net neutrality preserves the weird and wonderfulness of the Internet.
It’s time to save the Internet again.
Net neutrality is fundamental to free speech.
A healthy Internet is an even playing field where all can participate.
The more people that can participate in the web, the better the Internet, and the world will be.
It’s important to me to keep the Internet healthy.
It’s important that everyone, especially little guys, can participate in the future of the Internet.

Words are, in my not-so-humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic.
