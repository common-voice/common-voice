"I will trust you," she said at last.
"I will turn on the light," she said.
"I will wear what you please," she said, with a smile.
"I will, indeed," he replied cheerily.
"I will, miss," said Mr. Guppy.
"I will," he promised fervently.
"I wish Gray was here," he sighed.
"I wish I could," she murmured.
"I wish I was dead," said Ryan.
"I wish it was," he returned, "with all my heart."
"I wish it were," growls Tony, without changing his position.
"I wish to look at these shoes again," he said.
"I wonder if they will fit me," she said to Toto.
"I wonder where you found it," said Mrs. Q.
"I wondered where that shoe had got to," said Slater.
"I would like to kiss her!" she exclaims, panting tigress-like.
"I wrote a letter while we were taking our luncheon," he explained.
"I'd like that," said Darcie, brightening.
"I'd like to think it over," he, confessed.
"I'll give you a hand," said Goddard.
"I'll go and see," said French.
"I'll go up to him, then," says Mr. Tulkinghorn.
"I'll learn," he responded soberly.
"I'll see you some other time," said Gus.
"I'll send you over," suggested his grandfather surprisingly.
"I'll try not to be vain," said Frankie.
"I'll walk, thanks," said Don frigidly.
"I'm a miserable tool," said Russell.
"I'm a writer," he confessed sheepishly.
"I'm cleaning the upstairs back room, miss," replies Charley.
"I'm cold," she announced.
"I'm coming with you," he said.
"I'm getting nervous," said Moore.
"I'm going before Congress tomorrow, and I'd like to dictate my message.
"I'm heading for Glasgow tomorrow, Auntie," he cried.
"I'm mighty sorry," he answered in confusion.
"I'm not over strong," he repeated.
"I'm not sorry," protested Esme, with a choke.
"I'm not strong," he said after a discouraging silence.
"I'm not," she lied.
"I'm on," said that gentleman.
"I'm out of frocks," said the barman.
"I'm restless tonight," he said to himself.
"I'm sorry I wasn't," answered Cole dryly.
"I'm sorry if I'm trespassing," he said.
"I'm sorry," he said humbly.
"I'm sure it will," beamed Mrs. Gilbert.
"I'm sure it will," beamed Mrs. Graham.
"I'm very fond of reading," said Gray modestly.
"I'm very sorry," he said, a little impatiently.
"I'm very sorry," returned Dorothy; "please forgive us."
"I've brought you a message," he says.
"I've changed my mind," was the gruff answer.
"I've chosen you," said the Voice.
"I've gathered quite a few books," he said suddenly.
"I've got it," I said.
"I've got no quarrel with you," said the Voice.
"I've got the easy job," he said.
"I've spoken to him about F.," he announced.
"If it is not being troublesome," said we.
"If only we are in time!" he said, catching his breath.
"If you believe you are a good prophet," said I.
"If you like," she answered hurriedly.
"If you please, sir," said I.
"If you were to go to her;" He shook his head.
"Impossible," she repeated.
"Impudent dog," said Holmes without heat.
"In fact you're uncomfortably beautiful," he added.
"In the first place, here's an old portmanteau, sir," he says.
"In the meantime," I ventured to observe, "he is getting worse."
"In this newspaper," said the mariner.
"Indeed I do," he said, with a laugh.
"Indeed, I think so, Esther," replied she.
"Indeed, sir," said Mrs. Owen, much impressed.
"Is it," Mr. George muses, "blank cartridge or ball?"
"It absolutely beats me why you don't believe it," I said.
"It ain't any good waiting here," thinks Jo.
"It ain't indeed," replies the woman with a sigh.
"It all depends," I said.
"It began in your coming to our house," she said.
"It certainly has a faintly sooty aspect, sir," said Frost.
"It didn't cost me that much," was the answer.
"It draws," says Jo, "as heavy as a cart."
"It had better declare us poor at once," said Ada.
"It is a green fabric," he said very wisely.
"It is a tightish place," he admitted.
"It is all done," he said, with a nod of the head.
"It is green chiffon," he said.
"It is infamous," he cried passionately.
"It is killing we must do," repeated May.
"It is kind of you to like a Scarecrow," he replied.
"It is not likely to occur again," said I, smiling.
"It is not surprising," said he.
"It is not true, monsieur," cried Celia earnestly.
"It is still raining," he observed.
"It is terrible," he said.
"It is that that weighs on me," she cried.
"It is they," she cried.
"It is very difficult to help you," Watson was saying.
"It looks to me like tea," was her response.
"It may be," said the Lion.
"It might open a new world to him," said I.
"It must have been a sparrow," he said.
"It seems gloomy," said the Scarecrow.
"It seems we 'must,'" he said, with little grace.
"It shall wait here," said Ricardo.
"It sounded like that," was the admission.
"It was Dorothy," said the Lion, gravely.
"It was a powerful car?" "Sixty horse-power," he said.
"It was a shot," he said.
"It was a stirring scene," said May.
"It was an abominable lie," said Harrison crossly.
"It was an invigorating time," said Pritchard.
"It was in the north, sir, as we came down," observed Richard.
"It was just the kind of unexpected thing the Japanese would do.
"It was madame who wished you to believe," she stammered.
"It was me," said McGovern.
"It was not I who sent it," said Ricardo eagerly.
"It was pretty bad," he admitted.
"It will be necessary to keep that," he said.
"It will do us good to walk, madame," pleaded Adele.
"It will make no difference now," he said.
"It will seem longer," she said dismally.
"It would be kind," said Helene.
"It wouldn't be a bad idea," continued Blake.
"It's Gary's voice," she cried excitedly.
"It's a beast of a country," said the Voice.
"It's a beginning," said Moss.
"It's a hoax," said Mr. Stone.
"It's a mistake," he said.
"It's a most remarkable story," he said.
"It's a mystery," replied the Lion.
"It's a nice wee book," he observed at length.
"It's a quotation," said Elsie.
"It's a ticklish job," he whispered.
"It's about — " said Ada in a whisper.
"It's all for nothing!" he screamed rather than cried.
"It's all right," I said.
"It's all sunshine outdoors," he said gravely.
"It's as hard as the hams at the cheesemonger's," she said.
"It's beastly cheek," he repeated.
"It's been great fun, though, sir," argued Sullivan.
"It's coming on to rain," he observed.
"It's cursed luck," he said.
"It's devilish hard," said Mr. S..
"It's disgraceful," she said.
"It's fact," he said.
"It's horrible," he said.
"It's not the drink," said the Voice.
"It's not the kind of game you can win, Mom" said Jason
"It's quite ridiculous," he reflected.
"It's swelling up rather," said Beau.
"It's that," he said.
"It's the boy, miss," said he.
"It's the dampness drying," replied Jo.
"It's the devil," said Lee.
"It's the maddest thing I ever heard of," said Lucas angrily.
"It's the man from the inn," she announced.
"It's the only way," he said.
"It's thunder," said Phebe.
"It's too short," he repeated teasingly.
"It's twenty-four pounds, sixteen, and sevenpence ha'penny," observed the stranger.
"It's very modern, and I suppose very clever," she observed.
"It's very simple," said the Voice.
"Jason joined a guild today!" Emily shouted conspiratorily and in a girlish manner
"Jeeves," I said, "I had not expected this of you."
"Jeeves," I said, "a word with you."
"Jeeves," I said, "all this is a bit thick."
"Jeeves," I said, "do you know what?"
"Jeeves," I said, "may I speak frankly?"
"Jewels which she keeps in the safe in her bedroom," she added.
"Judy," says the old man, "have you got the pipe?"
"Just Dick and George," returned two voices reassuringly.
"Just Ellis and Maury," returned two voices reassuringly.
"Just another nut; let me crack them for you," said the chipmunk.
"Just as easily as he could give me brains," said the Scarecrow.
"Just as good as saw it," he returned.
"Just like me," he reflected.
"Just run through that wheeze again, Jeeves," I said thoughtfully.
"Just so, just so," the old man nods.
"Just so," observes the stationer with his confirmatory cough.
"Keep your hands so, please, mademoiselle," said Adele; "your fingers loose."
"Keep your nerve," said the Voice.
"Kill the wicked Witch of the West," answered Oz.
"Lead on," said Lee.
"Let it alone," said Tom Thumb; "and give me some fish!"
"Let me get up," said John.
"Let me hear," he said gravely.
"Let me kill — — " "Throw him out!"
"Let me look at your forehead," he says, bending down.
"Let me see," said I, pretending to consider.
"Let me see," said Richard, looking at his watch.
"Let me see," said she.
"Let us do it," said Juno thoughtfully.
"Let us go somewhere at any rate," said I.
"Let us go," he said.
"Let us start at the beginning," he resumed.
"Let's go back," he suggested.
"Let's have 'em all with my neck," suggested Gloria.
"Let's have Mrs. Campbell in," he ventured.
"Let's sit out here," she suggested.
"Let's try it," said Jo, who liked new experiments.
"Like as not — " began Mrs. Richards.
"Lily can," said Kerry, glad to recommend her sister.
"Listen then, my angel," says she after several sarcastic nods.
"Listen to me," he said solemnly.
"Listen," he said.
"Listen," said the Voice.
"Locate" is the pleasant word here.
"Lock him out," said Mrs. Poole.
"Look here, my good woman — " he began.
"Look here," said Mr. Rogers.
"Look here," said Tony, recoiling.
"Lovely evening," I said.
"Lovely," I agreed.
"Lucky you two cut away so quick," he said.
"Lucy, dearest — " Wearily she laid her head upon his shoulder.
"Mademoiselle has not moved," she said.
"Make your cat go down" the old lady angrily exclaimed.
"Mamma's enjoying herself," he observed to the teapot.
"Marrow puddings," he says instantly.
"Maybe it's being in love," he daringly observed.
"Memory is short," he thought.
"Meringues haven't got souls," said Elsie's mother.
"Might have been made for us," said Hopkins approvingly.
"Military time, sir," he replied.
"Miss Clare," said the Lord Chancellor.
"Miss Summerson really is my ward," he said.
"Miss Summerson," he repeated, and looked at me again.
"Mommy, I wish you were cleaning up after real bugs," Emily mused
"Monsieur is pleased to laugh at me," he said.
"Monsieur, I am speaking the truth," said the chauffeur.
"Monsieur," he cried, "something has been taken from this room."
"Monsieur," she said, "you do not go the right way."
"More hurt than surprised," said C.
"More than ever," he said.
"Most observing bird," said the old lady.
"Mother," returns the trooper, "is it too soon to ask a favour?"
"Mr. Barlitt speaks very highly of it," added Mr. Jackson.
"Mr. Guppy" is all the information the card yields.
"Mr. Jarndyce," he said, looking at it, "you have perused this?"
"Mr. Wilson, I suppose," said Hall.
"Mr. Woodcourt is his disinterested friend," I answered.
"Mrs. Porter," he said.
"My Lady is looking charmingly well," she says with another curtsy.
"My amiable child," he murmured, adjusting his cravat.
"My daddy's mad at me," she observed dispassionately.
"My dear, I don't know it," said I.
"My dearest Ada," asked Richard, "why not?"
"My dearest," he whispered huskily.
"My exquisite wife wearies of thought," remarked Caleb ironically.
"My first-fruits," he said, rather shyly.
"My friend, I also am remembering those words," he said.
"My instructions don't go to that," replies the constable.
"My place was by your side, Aunt Dahlia," I responded.
"Neither one thing nor the other," said the Voice.
"Neither," said the mariner.
"Never mind the patch," exclaimed the happy Woodman.
"Never," she answered, with a despondent but decided air.
"Nineteen," repeats my Lady thoughtfully.
"No bad news, I hope," said Susan.
"No doubt it's exasperating," said Martin, drily.
"No doubt, to you, but — " King laughed.
"No doubt," is Mr. Tulkinghorn's composed reply.
"No fear," said Hawkins.
"No handcuffs," stipulated the stranger.
"No idea of money," observed Mr. Bucket.
"No knife made it," he asserted.
"No one can pass," said he.
"No one knows it but you four — and myself," replied Oz.
"No one, sir," said Richard.
"No — " he began, but Alexander interrupted ruthlessly.
"No", said Celia, with a contemptuous laugh.
"No, I can't," returns the old man with a sudden grin.
"No, I don't," was the blunt reply.
"No, but you tried to," she retorted.
"No, he don't teach anything in particular," replied Caddy.
"No, my dear," said I.
"No, my friend, she could not cry out," he replied very seriously.
"No, my friend," he answered.
"No, no, my love," said he.
"No, sir," admitted the sergeant reluctantly.
"No, sir," said Austin patiently.
"No, that's a comfort," said Peter philosophically.
"No," answered the Scarecrow; "it's a lighted match."
"No," he said without turning.
"No," is the answer.
"No," said Brown emphatically.
"No," said Dorothy, "he's made of tin."
"No," said I, as she seemed to wait for me.
"No," said Miss Jellyby, softening.
"No," said Ricardo, with a smile.
"No," said Samuel Whiskers, "make it properly, with breadcrumbs."
"No," said both gentlemen at once.
"No," she answered simply.
"No; you are all wrong," said the little man, meekly.
"Nobody must show a light," Price observed.
"None whatever," said the stranger.
"Nonsense, my friend," he said, clapping the disconsolate man upon the shoulder.
"Nonsense," said the Voice.
"Nor I my heart," declared the Tin Woodman.
"Nor I," echoed the others.
"Nor could I — at the time," said he.
"Not I," he said softly.
"Not a bit like home," added Georgia.
"Not a bit of it," said Raycroft cheerfully.
"Not a bit of it," said the strange man.
"Not a bit," answered Skye.
"Not a word of it," said T., stoutly.
"Not at all," said Greta sincerely.
"Not at present," said Christopher.
"Not for a cat," said Murphy.
"Not he," said Morrison.
"Not in the least," said he.
"Not me," said his visitor.
"Not quite," replied Jo modestly.
"Not quite," stammered Frankie.
"Not the least doubt of it," answered Richard.
"Not through me," said Seb decidedly.
"Not to you," said Gussie.
"Not too quickly," he whispered.
"Nothing could have been worse," was Hallie's crushing reply.
"Nothing could have kept me away," I replied, touched.
"Nothing particular," returns the trooper.
"Nothing" said Jason, predictably
"Nothing," I said.
"Nothing," was the answer.
"Now I'll astonish uncle," she thought.
"Now for the door," said Lydia.
"Now for the house, men," said Tom.
"Now he's cross," said Wallace, looking after him.
"Now my turn," said Fred, as his hand came last.
"Now oil the joints in my arms," he said.
"Now that's all we want," concluded Mr. Houghton.
"Now that's interesting," said Mr. Lewis.
"Now you are going to tell me everything," he said.
"Now, Charlie," he would cry, "please let me explain!"
"Now, Miss Summerson," he said to me as we walked quickly away.
"Now, Miss Summerson," said he, "we are off!"
"Now, Small," says Mr. Guppy, "what would you recommend about pastry?"
"Now, come hither," says the housekeeper.
"Now, follow me," said the guide.
"Now, mistress," said the lawyer, tapping the key hastily upon the chimney-piece.
"Now," she adds, "show me the spot again!"
"O Lord," said the young man.
"Of course I cannot understand it," he said.
"Of course I promise, Aidan," she said.
"Of course he's stuffed," replied Dorothy, who was still angry.
"Of course not," answered Dorothy; "how should I?"
"Of course not," said Cal indignantly.
"Of course not," said madame briskly.
"Of course you should, you silly ass," said Gussie genially.
"Of course, Esther," he said, "you don't understand this business?"
"Of course, madame," she said, with a certain submissiveness which surprised Ricardo.
"Of course," answered the girl, "if he will see me."
"Of course," he protested.
"Of course," replied Celia.
"Oh come on, you must have done something" said his mother
"Oh yes; I am anxious," returned the Scarecrow.
"Oh — " Her voice was full of real distress.
"Oh, Fowler," he said.
"Oh, I don't go so far as that," he said reluctantly.
"Oh, I see;" said the Tin Woodman.
"Oh, I should think they're certain to," said Chad.
"Oh, I thought you were a sport," he was saying.
"Oh, Mrs. Woodcourt," said I, "that is so difficult!"
"Oh, Oz could do that easily enough," declared the man.
"Oh, all right," said Tomlinson.
"Oh, aye," replied Richard, "I'm all right."
"Oh, come now," said Clarke.
"Oh, come; that's not fair," began Ruth.
"Oh, dear no, miss," he said.
"Oh, don't be absurd," he protested.
"Oh, hullo" she said, enticingly.
"Oh, hullo, Tuppy," I said, "I wanted to see you."
"Oh, if it's that..." said the boots.
"Oh, indeed," said the Woodman, making a bow.
"Oh, look," she said.
"Oh, my dear," he returned with a hopeless gesture.
"Oh, my pretty face," she whispered, passionately grieving.
"Oh, no;" answered the Woodman.
"Oh, no;" declared the Scarecrow; "this Lion is a coward."
"Oh, no;" returned the soldier; "I have never seen him.
"Oh, poor child," said I; "let me out, if you please!"
"Oh, right ho," I said hastily.
"Oh, sorry," said Ari.
"Oh, that is different," said the Guardian of the Gates.
"Oh, that's different," Ethan asserted astoundingly.
"Oh, they won't do anything," he assured her.
"Oh, well, mine for instance," said Mavis, with a feeble laugh.
"Oh, yes, it has, my dear," he said laughingly.
"Oh, yes," he said.
"Oh, yes; sit down in that chair, please," replied Oz.
"Oh, yes; some of us are very good tinsmiths," they told her.
"Oh, yes; there are thousands," she replied.
"Oh, yes;" replied Dorothy.
"Oh, you'll be all right," I said.
"Oh," said Dorothy; "I'm awfully sorry for you."
"Oh," she said — and then: "I'm so sleepy."
"Oh," she said, coolly disappointed, "that all?"
"Oh," she said; "I know."
"Oil my neck, first," replied the Tin Woodman.
"On my honour," said the Voice, "I will kill you."
"On the contrary," he replied.
"On the other hand you have four thousand francs," protested the detective.
"On the spot, sir," said Stephenson affably.
"One does not usually discuss these matters in public," he said frigidly.
"One hundred lines, Freeman," he said.
"One minute," said the Voice, penetratingly, tremulous with self-control.
"One moment, Spiller," said Chambers.
"One moment, Spiller," said Jones.
"Only a matter of form, miss," returned the young gentleman.
"Only a runaway ring, sir," she answered.
"Only bid me good-night," said Richardson.
"Only for the best, guardian," said I.
"Only round the corner," said Mr. Guppy.
"Or give me a heart," said the Tin Woodman.
"Or he keeps us," suggested Richard.
"Or send me back to Kansas," said Dorothy.
"Or silly," said Jordan, and knuckled his eyes.
"Or somebody's shoes, sir," added Hawkins.
"Our Wilson is facetious," he remarked frostily.
"Our enemies soon discovered me," she went on.
"Out of the question," says the coroner.
"Over the other side, my man," said Mr. Ward.
"Over there in the river," answered the girl.
"Over thirteen, sir," replied the child.
"Peewit," said a peewit, very remote.
"Perfectly," said Adele in a malicious tone.
"Perfectly," said Henderson with some fervour.
"Perhaps Helene has fainted," she said anxiously: "she does not come."
"Perhaps there are wild beasts in the forest now," said Dorothy.
"Perhaps you have heart disease," said the Tin Woodman.
"Perhaps," said the friend, "it is a different thrush."
"Peter," — said little Benjamin, in a whisper — "who has got your clothes?"
"Pig-headed" is the word that springs to the lips.
"Pleasant day," said the mariner.
"Please God you are right," he said.
"Please God, yes," said Bennett.
"Please don't sit there," she said quickly.
"Please explain again," she said, taking out a notebook and pencil.
"Please keep sitting where you are," said the Invisible Man.
"Please sir, the chimney wants sweeping," said poor Tom.
"Please yourself," said the Chieftain and looked at Cooper.
"Please, don't, — " began Sienna, beseechingly.
"Please, sir — " said Spiller.
"Please, sir, we don't know," shrilled the chorus.
"Plenty," said Harper sourly.
"Pleurisy," sighed her Aunt, from the depths of the bath-tub.
"Poker," said N., and rushed to the hearth.
"Poor fellow," he said.
"Pour me another drink," she insisted.
"Powdered glass," said Mills.
"Pray tell us the story," says Watt in a half whisper.
"Precisely the same," said Mr. Badger.
"Pretty good," said Allison.
"Probably," returns Mr. Tulkinghorn, quietly blowing his nose.
"Promise not to rush the door," Lyra was saying.
"Push that in at the first post office you pass," I said.
"Put it down in the bill," snapped her visitor.
"Put that thing away, O'Brien," he said.
"Put the banknotes upon the table," he said hurriedly.
"Put those back again, Spencer," he said.
"Quick, Helene," said Celia. But Helene did not hurry.
"Quick," croaked Alan, "now's the time for the counter-attack."
"Quite enough," said Spencer.
"Quite so," said Adele comfortably.
"Quite," I replied guardedly.
"Quite," I said, a little hurriedly.
"Quite," said Mr. Sharp.
"Rather so, indeed, sir," responds Mr. Guppy.
"Read it, my dear Watt," says the housekeeper.
"Read it," he said.
"Reckon so," she agreed.
"Remain a moment, Esther," said he, "You were in my thoughts."
"Return of the exile," said Jordan.
"Richard," I urged, "it is not so hopeless as that?"
"Rick is mistaken, my dear," he would say to her.
"Right ho," I said.
"Right you are," said the intruder in the former voice.
"Right," said Banks quietly, and knocked him down.
"Sallie J. has four," began Amy.
"Same old futile cynic," he said.
"Say you love me," she would whisper.
"See for yourself," said Mr. Williams.
"See here, Mackintosh," he said solemnly.
"See here," he commanded.
"See how we have trained them," said Goodwin.
"See," he continued, "you are wrong: she is coming."
"Send in all the bills again to everybody 'with compts'" replied Ginger.
"Send your valet away," he said.
"Sensible to the last, Ty," said Dickson approvingly.
"She could not help it, for she is melted," explained the Scarecrow.
"She has left her footmarks clear enough," he whispered.
"She has no need of it," said he.
"She is -" he began.
"She is like the morning," he said.
"She is still weak," said the Commissaire.
"She looks honest," he said, with a sigh of relief.
"She means well," said Mr. Jarndyce hastily.
"She must be softened up," I said.
"She must have been a fine old lady, guv'nor," Phil observes.
"She seems quite happy," he said.
"She should have come by the omnibus," he repeated and repeated stupidly.
"She will do all she can to make me happy," said I.
"She's just the type for him," I said.
"She's sparkling, Aunt Catherine," said Harry pleasantly.
"She's sparkling, Aunt Catherine," said Richard pleasantly.
"She's worth her weight in gold," said the trooper.
"Shove it down, Aunt Dahlia," I said sympathetically.
"Show me the next room, Lawrence," he said, panting slightly.
"Shut the doors," said the policeman.
"Shut up!" said Jason
"Silly ass, Dunster," he groaned, "slamming about like that."
"Silly young geezer," I said.
"Sir, please, sir — " "Don't talk in the field, Yates."
"Sit down and let's hear about things," said Hamilton.
"Sit down and wait," suggested the lieutenant nonchalantly.
"Sit down, Burton," said the housemaster.
"Sit down, Grace," he said.
"Sit down, my dear," he said.
"Sixteen or seventeen, I should say," replied another voice.
"So I gave him notice," said Mrs. Blinder.
"So are you," said Gibbs.
"So be it," I said.
"So do I," said Reed.
"So do I," she confessed.
"So have I," said Ellinger.
"So he tells me," returned my guardian.
"So it is, so it is," returned my guardian hurriedly.
"So it might," my guardian assented.
"So the name was Adele," he whispered.
"So you may have, my dear," he returned.
"So you went at a walk," he said.
"So you were in the war," he said encouragingly.
"So you're writing," he said quickly.
"So, cousin," said the cheerful voice of Richard to Ada behind me.
"Some handkerchiefs, all hemmed," said Hollie.
"Sometimes," he answered modestly.
"Sorry to keep you waiting, Comrade Jackson," he said politely.
"Sounds like throwing the tablecloth about," said Rees.
"Speak to Esther, my dearest," said Richard, breaking the silence presently.
"Spiller's fiery nature is a byword," said Hardy.
"Spiller's fiery nature is a byword," said Jenkins.
"Sportsman," said Baker and held out his hand.
"Stand away, you two," he said.
"Still, she was not wearing them, I know," he said decisively.
"Stout fellow," he said.
"Stout fellow," said Martin; "and what did you find there?"
"Strange to stay so long," commented Ali curiously.
"Summer lightning," he thought.
"Suppose we call the Field Mice," she suggested.
"Sure is," said the second girl.
"Sure, I know," agreed the man with the plaid cap.
"Swore to it," said Andy with another snorting laugh.
"Tails up be dashed," was her sombre response.
"Tails up, Aunt Dahlia," I urged buoyantly.
"Take a seat," said the immaculate one.
"Tana went to sleep in the porch hammock," he remarked.
"Tea is ready," said the sour-faced maid; "where is the mistress?"
"Tea," said Norris; "we shall have to go now."
"Tell him to come up," said Hill.
"Tell me again," she said.
"Temporarily, yes," I had to admit.
"Thank you once more, mademoiselle," he said.
"Thank you very much, sir," said Aldo.
"Thank you, Jeeves," I said.
"Thank you," he answered, gratefully.
"Thank you," he answered.
"Thank you," he said, and the waiter moved away.
"Thank you," replied the girl; "that is very kind of Oz."
"Thank you," said Dorothy, gratefully.
"Thank you," said my guardian.
"That I wonder where you found it," said Mrs. R..
"That again? I don't see what you find so interesting about that game
"That can do little for an unhappy mind," said I.
"That is a first rate idea," said the Lion.
"That is because you have no brains," answered the girl.

'No,’ she said, looking slowly round.
'Not a mite more than I ought, ma'am.
'Not at all,’ replied Bob, with extreme civility.

And I poured alcohol into my stomach.
And I ran out into the garden, very unhappy.
And I said again, "I can't help it, Charley."
And I saw that he was very sorry for me.
And I saw them end.
And I shall find her as soon as I can.
And I should get cold feet if I tried again.
And I stopped it.
And I tell you what!
And I think Jo was quite right.
And I think she feels it.
And I think you're just in time.
And I too, a little while ago.
And I turned to Jeeves.
And I understand she leads him a terrible life.
And I waited seven more days, and he never said a word.
And I want leisure and quiet to think over things.
And I want to get married to Bobby.
And I want your help.
And I wanted to buy you another drink.
And I wanted to once again thank Linda Calise for her signing.
And I was very lonely — my life had been so different.
And I will learn — One thing I promise you.
And I will tell you more.
And I wish I'd never met one.
And I won’t try to imagine it away, either.
And I'll act in it.
And I'll go to Tarrytown and see Grampa.
And I'll go to town and see Grampa.
And I'll have had my good time.
And I'll tell 'ee what I'm thinking.
And I'll tell you why I said "Ha!"
And I'll tell you why I was blowed.
And I'll tell you why that will be the best plan.
And I've another job.
And I’ll tell you a secret—I can read words of one letter!
And I’m going to teach.
And I’m sure she’d do them well.
And I’m to have two recitations, Linda.
And I’m very concerned about this personally.
And I’ve an odd history.
And I’ve got none.
And Jane Andrews nearly fell overboard.
And Jeeves, of course, which is the thing that really matters.
And Jo stands shivering and looking at the breakfast wonderingly.
And Kathy examined her flowers with great interest.
And MacDougall was beyond the trail, with three weeks to spare.
And Maury's a cat.
And Miriam also refused to be approached.
And Miss Stacy explains everything so beautifully.
And Mr. Butcher spelled my name without an e, too.
And Mr. Hudson cleared his throat with a gratified noise.
And Mr. Pickwick and Sam entered accordingly.
And Mr. Ricardo ticked off his third point.
And Muriel and I had a lovely afternoon.
And Paul admired and loved and despised him slightly.
And Paul boasted of these sweets among his friends.
And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease and naturalness.
And Queen Ermintrude was asleep.
And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house.
And Reynolds, and Jackson.
And Ronnie, too, heard.
And Sam wouldn't be kind to you?
And Smith, and Rees.
And Sunday intervened — hour after hour of tension.
And Tom King patiently endured.
And William occupied her chiefly.
And William went to London, to start a new life.
And a long time afterwards she brought her another supply.
And a nice brother he is — half-brother I mean to say.
And a river went out of Eden to water the garden;
And a second afterwards, a tiny bright light shone.
And a very good name too.
And a whisky and soda, and so forth.
And abroad they want to see you.
And actually here’s a little brook!
And after that, more hypnotic wonders.
And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at her work.
And afterwards she furnished me with the sequel of Heathcliff’s history.
And again I was troubled — greatly troubled.
And again he laughed, in a way that tortured Miriam.
And again her strange smile illuminated her face.
And again the appeal sounded rather piteously.
And again, "Can't a man look at you?"
And all about him, the world was — strange.
And all that space of night from London home!
And all that stuff about having no soul.
And all the animals cried out in surprise.
And all the attachment of his soul would not keep him.
And all the time Paul was sporting with Clara.
And all the time her strange uneasiness grew.
And all the world gone mad.
And all they’re waiting for is for you to pass this bill.
And all through a foolish misunderstanding about a shark.
And all's fish that comes to my net.
And also ask for the benefits that we should get.
And another thing dawned upon him.
And another thing, my dear.
And are you emboldened?
And are you proposing to continue your stroll?
And aren't you?
And as captain of cricket, at that.
And as in denial of guilt, the one-legged boy replied.
And as never before, he was ready to obey.
And as the reflection darted across my mind I saw a slender chance.
And as we hurried up town, Joe Goose explained.
And asking Cleo if she takes sugar!
And at dinner you will push, as arranged?
And at last he made an end to speaking.
And at last he yielded and came to her.
And at last the postman came with his sack, laughing and jolly.
And at last they looked at Dorothy again.
And at once Celia became uneasy.
And at the same moment something else happened.
And at the same time I could save her from being plundered.
And at this moment a ringing "Hoy!"
And at this moment in she came.
And at this time she dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable.
And away went Sasha, glad to escape a lecture.
And back to Kansas? she asked, eagerly.
And be sure you never use it yourself.
And behave like a gentleman, mind!
And besides, Edgar has not been kind, has he?
And besides, I’m almost seventeen: I’m a woman.
And besides, how could anyone escape from these rooms?
And besides, only one half of him slept at a time.
And besides, they look nice in a bowl — they look jolly.
And besides, they’re not dirty.
And both women went indoors disgusted.
And bring me back the minute Isla is well?
And busy at his work he seemed to forget her.
And by a very stripling!
And can all the flowers talk?
And closing his eyes, he began trying to cross his legs again.
And come every single day?
And congratulating yourself on being up so soon?
And couldn't the sergeant see that my door was locked?
And curtsey while you’re thinking what to—what to purr.
And directly she came back we had this bust-up.
And do stop shouting downstairs.
And do you always lock the babies up when you go out?
And do you know why he tried to dissuade me?
And do you live alone here with these babies, Charley?
And do you often go out?
And do you think Mr. Woodcourt will make another voyage?
And don't you occupy yourself at all?
And don’t keep your mouth so wide open!
And don’t remind me of your existence again.
And down he went.
And downstairs she was led accordingly, accompanied by her affectionate son.
And dreary, and chill, and dismal, that morrow did creep over!
And each year something happened, and I did not go.
And enough to make it.
And even as she spoke her voice rang shrill and irritable up the stairs.
And even if they don't — Bertie, shall I tell you something?
And even in winter I can come home Fridays.
And even now, with this case, I hesitate.
And even then she was dazed.
And events had shown that my fears were well founded.
And every consideration has been shown.
And every one will think that Celia helped to murder and rob her benefactress.
And every step seemed like a weight on his chest.
And every voice clamoured for order in the chaos.
And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.
And everything is ready.
And everything that comfortable.
And everything was broken, except the mantelpiece.
And everywhere great multitudes of people.
And everywhere were pale features, lean limbs, disfigurement and degradation.
And far into the night he crooned that tune.
And father died four days afterwards from fever too.
And fell in love at first sight?
And finally, thank you.
And for precisely the same reason!
And for this we are to be thankful.
And for two seconds, no longer, she clasped him and kissed him.
And fourth, let’s end cancer as we know it.
And further on other people are buying annuities.
And get on, my lads!
And give her the works.
And go to the theatre, truly?
And good afternoon dear birches down in the hollow.
And good afternoon, dear gray house up on the hill.
And got it all by sleeping, dear eyes — just sleeping.
And grief and disappointment are hastening his death.
And guess what, prices of automobiles went up.
And hair as red as carrots!
And hark you, Heathcliff!
And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
And have been from a child.
And have taken vaccination and they suffer a lot after taking it.
And have the children looked after themselves at all, sir?
And he and my father were such friends!
And he came back to her.
And he caused her sorrow.
And he considered that he was perfectly honourable with regard to her.
And he could find no word to begin.
And he did hurt my arm.
And he fell into a trance.
And he fervently breathed his prayer for the last time.
And he flung up his hands.
And he had a great tenderness for Miriam.
And he had a similar defiance in his bearing and manner.
And he had changed his name to Black.
And he had earthly consolation and affections also.
And he had not come disguised.
And he had shown himself a fool.
And he had tears in his eyes too, Liliana.
And he has done nothing to embarrass us.
And he hated it.
And he held up the flap of the bar.
And he is a very clever boy, indeed.
And he is very great this day.
And he isn't conceited, is he?
And he knew he was as much to blame himself.
And he left the house before seven in the morning.
And he looked at me when I came away!
And he looked down at her.
And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea.
And he means it.
And he meant it too.
And he moved towards the staircase.
And he mumbled at her — words suspiciously like curses.
And he must be buried, you know.
And he opened his hand.
And he opened the door.
And he owed himself to her.
And he passed on without another question or remark.
And he passed on, leaving the two malcontents speechless.
And he persisted the more because his children hated it.
And he plays fives remarkably well!
And he raised no hand to set her free.
And he replaced the glass in his pocket.
And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
And he sat down with a disappointed air.
And he scarcely knew where he had been.
And he scarcely observed her.
And he sighed as if grieved at the confession.
And he spread out his hands with an impulsive gesture of despair.
And he still looks a young man.
And he teases the girls something terrible.
And he thought of Oona, and of her words.
And he told how matters stood with him.
And he touched the tins.
And he turned and walked by Helene's side.
And he walked away.
And he was almost ashamed to go to his public-house that evening.
And he was at pains to write it out.
And he was filled with a strange and foreboding fear.
And he was promised then, promised certainly the next time.
And he was too far gone to be helped out of that.
And he was usually late again.
And he wasn't.
And he wasn’t equal to getting a carriage.
And he went away to the other girls.
And he went for his train.
And he went on striking.
And he will come back enlightened.
And he would let other girls, why not her?
And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation.
And he wrote to her frequently.
And he'll be in the same scrape again next week!
And he's ashamed of it.
And he's just the same today.
And he's just the type for her.
And he's upstairs free as the air.
And help your own naughty pet and mine.
And her diary was mostly a love-letter.
And her father was a rake.
And her voice sank into a solemn whisper, pathetically ludicrous.
And her voice was feverish.
And here are the contemporary novelists.
And here is a best of collection of recorded microphone screams.
And here she sobbed too.
And here's another idea.
And here, she is seized with an inspiration.
And here’s the plan: First – cut the cost of prescription drugs.
And him a new guest and wanting to stay!
And his answering immediately to the last question.
And his awakening had not been natural!
And his behaviour, so strikingly altered — what could it mean?
And his eyes had been horribly intelligent.
And his father is dependent on him in the Vale of Taunton.
And his foot was bleeding.
And his lodging in Walthamstow was so dreary.
And his mother knew he was gone.
And his people awaited him!
And his sisters are charming women.
And his table manners were irritating.
And holding that handkerchief over his mouth all the time.
And how about this pessimism we hear of?
And how are you transplanted here, Mrs. Dean?
And how are you, my dear boy?
And how are you, sir to Mr. Winkle?
And how beautiful we thought he looked!
And how can I pay?
And how did Lady Brandon describe this wonderful young man?
And how did he react to that?
And how did my wife get that black eye?
And how did you like Mrs. Jellyby, my dear?
And how did you like the ride?
And how did you reassure him?
And how do you come to be the messenger?
And how do you find yourself, my poor lad?
And how do you get on, Richard?
And how do you get on?
And how do you live, Charley?
And how fast it comes!
And how have I destroyed it?
And how is your mama?
And how long did this nuisance continue?
And how long were you in the hole?
And how odd the directions will look!
And how old are you, child!
And how quiet the horses are!
And how tired you must be after your journey!
And how was she to punish her?
And how would we ever find ourselves.
And if anything happens while we dine?
And if he did anything I shouldn’t mind.
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much.
And if not, is he a devil?
And if that was so, how did it affect him?
And if that were true — why, there were my sofa cushions partly explained.
And if they are, it's worth nothing to me.
And if you were me?
And in a second he was back at the window.
And in an instant the thing had passed.
And in his mind he added: "God forgive me for the lie."
And in the darkness his voice came querulously between long breaths.
And in the end it frightened her.
And in the end she shared almost everything with him without knowing.
And in the fullness of that knowledge a great fear assailed her.
And in the meanwhile leave Bleak House?
And in the ponds too!
And in the same way she waited for him.
And in they went.
And in time the thing becomes a habit.
And in very embarrassed circumstances.
And indeed I’m not vain about it.
And indeed he has no such wish at present.
And indeed, she walked very dizzily.
And instead of relying on foreign supply chains, let’s make it in America.
And invent bugbear stories to terrify her from my door?
And isn't the Bishop going to have tea?
And it had taken so long — so terribly long!
And it is a good likeness?
And it is killing we must do, Matthews.
And it might lead to mistaken notions, you see.
And it reads like rage growing to mania!
And it really was a kitten, after all.
And it stirred.
And it surprised me more than it does you.
And it was all his doing!
And it was all over.
And it was as I had suspected.
And it was here that the Barbary pirates lived.
And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.
And it was very good of you, too.
And it worked. There was a political and media stampede.
And it works.
And it's actually won.
And it's no good looking like that.
And it's now about half-past nine at night.
And it's still at it.
And its also destroying the country.
And it’s a quarter to three.
And it’s so interesting.
And it’s under assault.
And jam a chair against it.
And just now, we have these books.
And just send those books I promised to lend him?
And just think of the things he might do!
And leave me go.
And leave you two?
And let me sit quiet for a minute.
And let's get it over.
And let’s continue to advance maternal health care in America.
And let’s get all Americans the mental health services they need.
And listen to this, Quentin.
And listen: you can make a lot of money doctoring animals.
And look at that poor unfortunate child!
And looked like something on a slab?
And make a speech?
And makes an imploring moan.
And many had died.
And many of the tales that Chee-Chee told were very interesting.
And many people consider the medium dose for an adult two days.
And meanwhile the boy has no one to look after him.
And mind you tell us the truth here, whatever you do, Jo.
And more bridge and tunnel closings throughout the city are very possible.
And much less than a friend.
And my baggage contains apparatus and appliances.
And my father, my dear, dear father!
And my heart's weak.
And my mind requires to be so very clear, you know!
And no apology was left, no message for me.
And no doubt he will.
And no snuff — plenty of pipes and cigarettes, and a few cigars.
And no wonder in this evil place.
And nobody else mattered.
And none other will know of them until he dies.
And not clear either.
And not only fogged — wounded and resentful.
And not only trembling, but shivering.
And not upon my words.
And not you, I swear!
And nothing more was ever seen of that gentleman.
And nothing was wrung from her.
And now I can comprehend his behaviour.
And now I don't so much care how it ends.
And now I will ask you a question in return.
And now I'm for a bite and a pipe.
And now about the Sunday school.
And now behold the perversity of things.
And now he positively ached for a game.
And now he too could look in.
And now help me on.
And now here is a minor point.
And now here we are!
And now it's nearly dinner-time, you say?
And now let's start our innings.
And now put yourself in my place for a moment.
And now she felt strangely towards the infant.
And now she lies in her room murdered!
And now she lies murdered for a reward!
And now she was sure that Adele was the name used.
And now that he has acted the free world is holding him accountable.
And now that you are here, listen.
And now the situation is reversed.
And now this “purity” prevented even their first love-kiss.
And now very soon the monkeys began to get better.
And now what am I to do?
And now you stammer out those halting words.
And now you're off for an evening's pleasure.
And now you’d better go!
And now — I cannot.
And now, Bertie, like a good chap, shove off.
And now, Mcdonald, what else?
And now, down there, Eileen was waiting for him.
And now, guess what your good children were doing?
And now, let me talk to you of something else.
And now, let us hear what you are unhappy about.
And now, who am I?
And of course Alan never knew.
And of course I shook my head.
And of encouraging them by making these houses show-places.
And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds!
And oh, how Debbie Pye will laugh!
And oh, how Josie Browne will laugh!
And oh, it’s a wonderful Christmas.
And oh, this dearth of the human physiognomy!
And oh, what shall I do?
And on Jip’s face there was a worried look.
And on no account disturb him in the library.
And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made;
And one of them seemed quite poorly.
And one, I tell you, is coming now.
And only one for birthday presents, you know.
And only think: love!
And only well-to-do people matter now.
And out came the grievance.
And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree
And outside a snowstorm was beginning.
And people don't want us.
And people laugh at me because I use big words.
And personally I hate New Jersey.
And pigs for people.
And play card games on the commuting trains.
And poor Mr. Darcy!
And poor ones at that.
And pray has he done so?
And pray what sort of guardians do you make?
And presently he came back with all the things they wanted.
And presently he returned with the vital essence.
And presently the Doctor saw the island they had spoken of.
And presently they were all laughing together.
And put on an evening suit, will you?
And really he did look very like it.
And really, for so smart a young lady, you look too ridiculous.
And recollect you won't get off so easy next time.
And right there I saw and knew it all.
And round went the poker again, more fiercely than before.
And said he played the fife.
And saying that we will do the best for the state and so on.
And she and William retired to the sofa and wept.
And she bobbed a little curtsey of delight.
And she bowed under her suffering.
And she came to play the piano whilst he sang.
And she can’t help it.
And she caught her breath and whimpered.
And she could do nothing for him.
And she could not get to him.
And she could not.
And she did not care for Miriam.
And she dresses as well as any woman in London.
And she felt she must live now, to be with her children.
And she had not told Harry!
And she handed the basket to the Scarecrow.
And she handed the paper back.
And she has acted up to it: glorious!
And she has been very kind to me.
And she has laid in a remarkable assortment of bargains.
And she helped the Woodman up again.
And she hung it on a nail in the kitchen.
And she ironed it and folded it, and put it on one side.
And she is a good-natured woman after all.
And she kept her word?
And she laid the keys upon the dressing-table or the mantel-shelf.
And she let you go again? asked the man, in wonder.
And she lets you?
And she looked real nice too.
And she moved towards the stairs.
And she named a small cafe in a back street.
And she passed on, leaving Harry rooted to the ground.
And she read your book to me.
And she really likes it?
And she really never heard of the cause!
And she rose and got the books.
And she said there were trees all around it.
And she still had the Bible that John Field had given her.
And she tied the girl's thumbs and little fingers.
And she walked without her hat.
And she wanted herself to be a school-teacher.
And she wanted him in the end to marry a lady.
And she was angry, too.
And she was getting medicine for him?
And she was good to him.
And she was never caught out!
And she was only sixteen last June.
And she was quite content.
And she will be all right again tomorrow?
And she yearned to him.
And she’s such a capital one for catching mice you can’t think!
And small loss to his family whenever he drops off.
And smells that nice!
And so Esther, my dear, you are happy for life.
And so did Mrs. Forster.
And so early in the voyage, too.
And so extremely accomplished for her age!
And so for a while we spoke of neutral topics.
And so he broke himself.
And so it was arranged.
And so it was in everything.
And so it was with the new breakfast food.
And so often William manifested the same hatred towards his betrothed.
And so on, if you get my drift, and so forth.
And so the seances went on.
And so the state of the car is explained.
And so we all moved to the village.
And so we danced an hour by the clock.
And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to apply.
And so you like this man's sisters, too, do you?
And so you shall, like an angel as you are!
And so young a girl to be involved in it!
And so you’re sort of caught between a rock and a hard place.
And so, in the circumstances, might Gussie too, I should think.
And so, to do him justice, he did.
And some of this would be true.
And somehow, because of her, he gradually realised where he was wrong.
And somehow, she was hurt.
And something else supports me, Esther.
And soon, for the money I had was almost exhausted.
And still Celia slept.
And still it was like the horror of a dream.
And still she preserved John Field’s Bible.
And still there was something else, something outside, something he wanted.
And still there was the same shade between me and my darling.
And still they are promoting the vaccines.
And such an occasion was the present.
And suddenly Rupert struck them.
And suddenly his face grew very stern.
And suddenly she smiled.
And suddenly, Mr. Ricardo began to reflect.
And supposing the lady became violent?
And swan girls and parrot girls.
And take care they do not spoil you by flattery, child!
And talk about you?
And thank you very much for asking,’ said Tweedledum.
And thank you very much for coming to tell me.
And that afternoon he had to take them.
And that foul innkeeper and that brigand at the gate.
And that grocer lout?
And that insipid, paltry creature attending her from duty and humanity!
And that is not all.
And that is the God’s honest truth.
And that is the slavering, shivering thing you preferred to me!
And that reminds me.
And that strengthens my argument.
And that too they will rule over you for five years.
And that was another most consummate vagabond!
And that was how the fateful idea came to them.
And that was like me!
And that was the last of Francois and Perrault.
And that was the night it happened?
And that wind sounding in the firs by the lattice.
And that's all he does!
And that's all.
And that's how I know how.
And that's my point.
And that's our cool, reserved, and worldly Harper!
And that’s something.
And the Edinburgh Evening News says, with editorial gloom.
And the Eurasian Chinese-Englishman bowed himself away.
And the Governor’s Office and my office have talked today.
And the Lion answered, "I am a Cowardly Lion, afraid of everything".
And the Lion would answer, "No".
And the Queen seemed to guess her thoughts, for she cried, ‘Faster!’
And the Ukrainian student next to her might not appreciate it.
And the agitated voice and words remained fixed in his memory.
And the air was growing chilly.
And the battle is beginning.
And the best of it is, Hareton is damnably fond of me!
And the best of it was that they did not even know my name.
And the big Persian knew of his existence before he did of hers.
And the big towns grew.
And the brooch is gone, there’s nothing surer.
And the chef is staying on.
And the children went to bed, miserably.
And the detective resumed at once his brisk voice and alert manner.
And the earth brought forth grass
And the earth was without form, and void.
And the end had been a tragedy that oppressed him.
And the evening and the moming were the first day.
And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
And the evening and the morning were the second day.
And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.
And the evening and the morning were the third day.
And the first chap I ran into was young Tuppy.
And the foundation stone of service, in his case, was obedience.
And the frock in which she went away was of green chiffon over satin.
And the front door's unbolted.
And the furniture was old and battered.
And the gold of that land is good:
And the government is like this and like that.
And the hue of it was a deepening misery.
And the letters are destroyed with the person?
And the matron she said thought I would do.
And the mind of the thoroughly well-informed man is a dreadful thing.
And the money he had saved up grew littler and littler.
And the money was just sufficient.
And the money's gone!
And the name of the second river is nile
And the name of the third river is Hudson
And the natives were very kind.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids’ trifles.
And the night had fallen.
And the old lady pottered off gleefully.
And the other thing is a mouse-trap.
And the overall state economy grew.
And the people only ready!
And the process failed.
And the question was her answer.
And the same is true for our elected officials and our government.
And the scenery, and all that sort of thing.
And the snow had warned me of other dangers.
And the students, the cramped means!
And the systematised sensuality of a class of rich men!
And the tears swam in her eyes.
And the three turned away.
And the wind was soft and warm and wet.
And the wind’s all lovely and wet.
And their chief virtue lies in that they will never wear out.
And then I became a married man.
And then I can imagine that I’m dressed gorgeously.
And then I can take you away from here.
And then I found myself looking down the skylight.
And then I had a brilliant idea.
And then I said my prayers and thought a little more.
And then I suddenly got it.
And then I think I became unconscious.
And then I will begin to tell you.
And then I’d just feel a prayer.
And then a shadow came between Rocco and the sun.
And then a thing incomprehensible to her happened.
And then almost immediately he fell asleep.
And then came a curious experience.
And then came a remote disorder.
And then comes a voice.
And then ensued a long ghastly vigil of watching and waiting.
And then he came forward.
And then he discussed his sweetheart endlessly with his mother.
And then he looked straight down between his feet.
And then he realised that the boy had been right.
And then he realised, consciously, that it was no good.
And then he spoke again in French to Helene.
And then he took her words humbly.
And then into it came recognition.
And then it rose.
And then one was at school with the man.
And then she answered you, 'No, we have other plans.'
And then she did give me a look.
And then she kissed him.
And then she knew it was.
And then something did happen.
And then suddenly F. was gone and he stood alone.
And then suddenly I thought of you.
And then suddenly a sort of glow came into his face.
And then suddenly she knew how tired her eyes were.
And then that voice singing!
And then the real truth flashed in upon her blindingly.
And then there came a strange and human turn to the affair.
And then they argued as to which of the two it was.
And then they both looked at him.
And then they crept up to the window to listen.
And then they treat you like this.
And then they'd say, 'What are you doing here?'
And then things happened very swiftly.
And then we were so merry all the way home!
And then when we came away it was such fun!
And then you go on about how twilight always makes you sad.
And then, at ten o’clock, he set off.
And then, feeling rather sick, he went to look for some parsley.
And then, one fairy night, May became June.
And then, steadily, he began to chew.
And then, the next day, Clara came.
And then, what a rush of tenderness and humility!
And then, with her next words, illumination dawned on him.
And there I see him waiting to be summoned.
And there are plenty of vegetables left in the garden.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle.
And there is my slit in the sofa cushions.
And there is no opposition to rule it out.
And there is no way round.
And there she is — a bronchial subject!
And there should be allowances made, Jenna.
And there they are!
And there was Ethel Baird, whom also you must remember.
And there was a dog that barked.
And there was always the bend in the road!
And there was no chance of doing it.
And there was science to an unlimited extent.
And there was someone rapping at the door.
And there was something beyond that; he knew now.
And there was unheard-of extravagance in the larder.
And there wasn't an arm!
And there would be poor Emma in the carriage behind.
And there would have been none but for Helene.
And there you are, my partner, eh?
And there you sit, I suppose, all the day long, eh?
And there's no chivalry, no quarter shown in this fight.
And there's not such another.
And these others — the Councillors, Paisley.
And they all gathered round to have a look.
And they all lived happily ever after.
And they are respectable people.
And they are very angry?
And they aren't strong this year.
And they both set up a heart-breaking cry.
And they don't think he's come in.
And they found it, as people generally do, difficult to believe.
And they had hit.
And they have died in vain.
And they have physical culture exercises every morning and evening.
And they have shot him.
And they left the arrangements for the summer prize-giving to me.
And they might, ah, they might!
And they passed on.
And they produced flying machines.
And they quarrel so dreadfully!
And they shook hands heartily.
And they stared so!
And they used to dance like elves of delight.
And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
And they were covered with mud.
And they were pointing over to him and shouting.
And they won't leave the people who are not vaccinated till now.
And they’ve slipped back.
And this belief grew and haunted him.
And this belief produced another dread.
And this extraordinary man took up his pen again.
And this indecision seemed to bleed him of his energy.
And this is brother, is it, my dears?
And this is not a conspiracy, perhaps?
And this is your establishment?
And this room’s secluded silence was eloquent of imprisonment!
And this time there were answering cries.
And this was a new torture to him.
And this was a particularly messy mess.
And this was the first passage of Mr. Weller’s first love.
And this was their sole conversation throughout the meal.
And this was what prevented him.
And those are only a few of the easy smells — the strong ones.
And those gold teeth!
And through and through the vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
And through the chinks in the curtain the bright light shone.
And to attend the court no more?
And to be kept back on such a motive!
And to confer upon me the favour of your distinguished recommendation?
And to drink? Name the poison.
And to give no sign!
And to me that would mean so much.
And to rule over the day and over the night
And to see dear Wickham too!
And to tell you the truth, guardian, I rather expected it.
And to this question Helene smiled — a quiet, slow, confidential smile.
And to you they are memories.
And toddle off quite happily to find another.
And tomorrow night, they will come into my possession.
And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows.
And two other little beds.
And underneath the umbrella the chimpanzees still get wet.
And upon that a worse thing befell her.
And upon that the voice ceased.
And very much indebted to you.
And very well indeed you are looking.
And was the gentleman responsive?
And watch out for wet feet, was his parting advice.
And we are reviving the ancient arts.
And we can have the room, sir?
And we didn’t always get it quite right.
And we had the ice cream.
And we have all our dishes on them.
And we have been told that Oz is a good Wizard.
And we have hardly a five-franc piece in the house.
And we know that she was back at the villa soon after nine.
And we like 'em all the better for it, don't we?
And we must demand that government continue to perform and achieve and accomplish.
And we shall find out where the rest is hid — from her.
And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.
And we will be stronger a year from now than we are today.
And we will really take off.
And we will, as one people.
And we won’t stop.
And we've got some Boy-scouts helping us as auxiliaries.
And well you may.
And went away singing to himself.
And what I say unto you, I say unto all, Watch!
And what a funny smell!
And what about my side of the thing?

And when Emma's tired, he puts her to bed.
And when I described it to Pongo last night, he was fascinated.
And when I got downstairs, oh, how I cried!
And when he was with her he was cruel again.
And when he's tired he goes to bed himself.
And when she smiled he explained.
And when the smell of hay was in the air!
And when they came back it was almost night.

And while we’re at it let Medicare negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs.
And who are you calling Richard Hannay?
And who have we got here tonight?

And why did she take it, do you suppose?
And why do I despise him?
And why do we need refreshment, my friends?
And why is it so?
And why is that? asked the Scarecrow.
And why let her wear saffron colour?
And why not, boys and ladies and gentlemen?
And why not?
And why should you take trouble?

And yet it is quite simple.
And yet it was not enough.
And yet not quite, as you shall hear.
And yet she hated men at the same time.
And yet the two never looked at each other save in hostility.
And yet their talk holds nothing obnoxiously fond or flirtatious.
And yet upstairs the atmosphere among them was always jolly and clear.
And yet you never said a word about it!
And yet, cruel Heathcliff!
And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
And you are Heathcliff!
And you are an insignificant-looking little weed.
And you are my assistant-custodian.
And you are to go down at twelve?
And you are?
And you came away feeling that he needed a bracer?
And you can refuse, you mean, eh?
And you conspire with him against me, do you, viper?
And you could do it so easily.
And you did this?
And you do so much, so unpretendingly!
And you don't think it's an answer, eh?
And you don't think the patient would object to him?
And you dynamited his hermitage, after he had saved you from the police.
And you had better have a couple of quick ones first.
And you have been very kind to me, Jeeves.
And you have placed guards at all the entrances?
And you join him against her.
And you knew her young companion?
And you know the knavish system of the scientific world.
And you know what that means.
And you made the right decision and you led the nation in changing policy.
And you may come with me.
And you only the second.
And you preferred a cannibal isle and a cartridge belt.
And you remember what an enormous dinner he had.
And you shall have it.
And you should be glad to go home, and to see him.
And you talk about boils!
And you tell me she loves me still!
And you troubled no more about the hunchback?
And you understand, don’t you?
And you walk too fast.
And you want me to tell stories!
And you want to contest a provision of the will?
And you were kidnapped by wicked sailors and brought to England.
And you were losing last night too.
And you will come there too, I hope, Rick.
And you will have such nice rambles on the moors.
And you won't tease me in private?
And you won’t.
And you're going to let me go!
And you're still making fudge, right?
And you're very charming.
And you've pretty near broken my toe.
And you, my friend, I should counsel you to get some sleep.
And your aunt.
And your house will be the blotting-pad.
And your master, young man!
And your papa; what did he say?
And you’d have deserved it, you little mischievous darling!
And you’ve been along with me, Kitty—all through the Looking-Glass world.

And, after all, it had been an obsolete list.
And, among other changes, I have changed.
And, as I spoke, Gussie came sidling out from behind a tree.
And, as he gazed, he closed his eyes and shivered.
And, as he got out unnoticed, so he could return.
And, as he stooped, his trousers split up the back.
And, as you rightly remark, jam a chair against it.
And, by Jove, he was absolutely right.
And, finally, its culminating stroke was the introduction of flying.
And, furthermore, based on the psychology of the individual.
And, how did they know the exact type of laptop that you want?
And, if you do, what is it about?
And, in truth, she was not afraid of them.
And, indeed, what are these miseries of which you speak?
And, mind this, one of the two women is guilty.
And, once again, I am glad to see you, Watt!
And, so far as they knew, they were quite right.

‘A hundred,’ said the little man.
‘A likely story indeed!’ said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt.
‘A little, Sir,’ replied that gentleman.
‘A little, if you please,’ replied Mary.
‘A little—a little,’ the King replied, rather nervously.
‘A man of wrath!’ he exclaimed.
‘A quarter to two,’ he said, looking at the parlour clock.
‘A strange choice of favourites!’ she observed scornfully.
‘A strange man!’ shrieked the lady.
‘A very agreeable portrait,’ I observed to the housekeeper.
‘About his work in the stable,’ was my answer.
‘Accommodation, eh?’ said that gentleman, consulting a large book.
‘Ah!’ exclaimed the old lady.
‘Ah!’ said Master Charles Bates; ‘he don’t know what’s good for him.’
‘Ah, so it is,’ said Mrs. Weller, setting her cap to rights.
‘Ah, what is it, now?’ the Unicorn cried eagerly.
‘Ahem!’ said the Mouse with an important air, ‘are you all ready?’
‘All right, sir,’ replied Mr. Weller, pausing.
‘All right,’ replied Mr. Winkle faintly.
‘All right,’ said Mr. Snodgrass.
‘All round the town?’ he said.
‘All well at the Heights?’ I inquired of the woman.
‘Amiable man that Sammy,’ said Mr. Weller, smoking violently.
‘Among his books!’ she cried, confounded.
‘An abstruse subject, I should conceive,’ he said.
‘An awful Sunday,’ commenced the paragraph beneath.
‘And be here again next Thursday,’ continued he, shunning her puzzled gaze.
‘And bring some soda-water,’ said Bob Sawyer.
‘And darker,’ said Tweedledee.
‘And he spoke to me,’ she added, with a perplexed countenance.
‘And how did you know I was here?’ inquired Mary.
‘And how did you manage on the twelfth?’ Alice went on eagerly.
‘And how’s father?’ said Sam.
‘And me,’ interposed his wife.
‘And nowhere else?’ I demanded.
‘And she loved mine,’ added he.
‘And she suffered him!’ exclaimed the old lady.
‘And so it is, surely,’ said a third fat man.
‘And so it’s a secret?’ said Sam.
‘And that’s very true,’ said the placid one.
‘And those other gentlemen?’ ‘They are going also,’ he said.
‘And twenty,’ said Mr. Jingle.
‘And washing?’ said the Mock Turtle.
‘And what are you?’ inquired Catherine, gazing curiously on the speaker.
‘And what do you learn from daddy?’ I continued.
‘And what enormous flowers they must be!’ was her next idea.
‘And who ordered you to obey her?’ he added, turning to Hareton.
‘And why not, sir — why not?’ he said, turning warmly upon him.
‘And with too good reason,’ added Mrs. Weller gravely.
‘And you told a deliberate untruth!’ he said.
‘And you were all the better for it, I know!’ the Queen said triumphantly.
‘And your little boy — ’ said Mr. Pickwick.
‘And you’ll be my friend?’ added Catherine, interrogatively.
‘Another sandwich!’ said the King.
‘Any luggage, Sir?’ inquired the coachman.
‘Any maker’s name?’ ‘Brown.’ ‘Where of?’ ‘Muggleton'.
‘Anything new?’ ‘No, nothing particular'.
‘Anything you like,’ said the Footman, and began whistling.
‘Are their heads off?’ shouted the Queen.
‘Are there any lions or tigers about here?’ she asked timidly.
‘Are there many crabs here?’ said Alice.
‘Are they pointing?’ No, no; not now.
‘Are we nearly there?’ Alice managed to pant out at last.
‘Are you a cricketer?’ inquired Mr. Wardle of the marksman.
‘Are you animal—vegetable—or mineral?’ he said, yawning at every other word.
‘Are you content now?’ said the Caterpillar.
‘Are you deaf?’ inquired the little old gentleman.
‘Are you faint?’ inquired the anxious Rachael.
‘Are you going anywhere?’ ‘No, it is raining,’ she answered.
‘Are you going to listen to her ravings?’ I said, passionately.
‘Are you hurt?’ inquired Mr. Benjamin Allen, with great anxiety.
‘Are you mad, sir?’ he demanded.
‘Are you married?’ inquired the dirty-faced man.
‘Are you to get in at all?’ said the Footman.
‘As a bandit,’ repeated Mr. Tupman, mildly.
‘As well as you can,’ said the Tiger-lily.
‘Ask him to step here.’ ‘Yes, sir.’
‘Ask the landlady of the White Hart about that, Sir,’ replied Sam
‘Assembly, eh?’ ‘No, Sir, not assembly, Sir'.
‘At a boarding-school?’ said Sam.
‘At ten precisely, I will be there,’ said the little man.
‘Aunt Isabella had not you and me to nurse her,’ I replied.
‘Ay — nay,’ he drawled.
‘Be quiet’ resumed Wardle.
‘Beautiful indeed,’ he replied.
‘Because he can’t,’ said Mr. Grundy.
‘Beg your pardon, sir,’ said Wilkins.
‘Begone!’ I shouted.
‘Bless his heart!’ she interposed, with a maternal sob.
‘Bless my heart!’ he exclaimed, turning round again.
‘Bless us!’ said the lady.
‘Bless your heart, sir, servants always do,’ replied Mr. Weller.
‘Bless your innocence, sir, that ain’t it,’ replied Sam.
‘Blew—me—up,’ panted the Queen, who was still a little out of breath.
‘Bravo!’ Mr. Pickwick was heard to exclaim, from the passage.
‘But I do,’ said her cousin, shuddering.
‘But I’ll have it,’ he said, ‘when I want it'.
‘But I’m not a serpent, I tell you!’ said Alice.
‘But I’m not used to it!’ pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.
‘But about his toes?’ the Mock Turtle persisted.
‘But don’t you think it means more?’ inquired Sam.
‘But he can be found,’ said the ardent Mr. Tupman, interposing.
‘But he won’t come!’ roared Mr. Winkle.
‘But she must have a prize herself, you know,’ said the Mouse.
‘But stay,’ he continued, turning towards the young lady.
‘But you shall answer it, Sir.’ ‘Answer what?’ he said.
‘But you won’t let him strike me?’ she cried.
‘By no means!’ cried Mrs. Linton in answer.
‘By-the-bye, what became of the baby?’ said the Cat.
‘Cab!’ he called.
‘Call it what you like,’ said the Cat.
‘Call the next witness!’ said the King.
‘Can I speak to Mr. Winkle, sir?’ replied Boots from the outside.
‘Can anything be finer or more delightful?’ he inquired of Mr. Winkle.
‘Can we have beds here?’ he inquired, summoning the waiter.
‘Can you answer useful questions?’ she said.
‘Can you drive?’ said the fat boy.
‘Can you guess why I did that?’ he said to Alice.
‘Can you keep from crying by considering things?’ she asked.
‘Can’t you?’ the Queen said in a pitying tone.
‘Capital dinners he gave; fine port, too,’ he remarked.
‘Capital!’ echoed both Mr. Snodgrass and Mr. Winkle.
‘Capital!’ said Mr. Winkle, who was carving a fowl on the box.
‘Catherine Linton,’ it replied, shiveringly why did I think of Linton?
‘Cathy, are you busy this afternoon?’ asked Heathcliff.
‘Cathy, this lamb of yours threatens like a bull!’ he said.
‘Certainly not!’ said Alice indignantly.
‘Certainly not,’ he replied eagerly; ‘not on any account'.
‘Certainly not,’ he responded.
‘Certainly not,’ replied Mr. Snodgrass.
‘Certainly not,’ replied the little doctor.
‘Certainly, ma’am,’ he interposed, very quickly.
‘Certainly, sir,’ replied the testy little judge.
‘Certainly,’ added the doctor.
‘Certainly,’ replied Mr. Snodgrass.
‘Certainly,’ replied Sam.
‘Certainly,’ replied the landlord.
‘Certainly,’ replied the unwelcome visitor.
‘Certainly’ said Mr. Pickwick; and down they sat.
‘Change engines—’ it said, and was obliged to leave off.
‘Change lobsters again!’ it yelled at the top of its voice.
‘Charming women,’ said Mr. Tupman.
‘Check!’ and Alice looked round in some surprise for the new enemy.
‘Clear-headed, strong-minded person,’ added Mr. Snodgrass.
‘Close by, Sir,’ said the waiter, ‘not above five hundred yards'.
‘Coach is ready, Sir,’ said Sam, appearing at the door.
‘Collar that Dormouse,’ the Queen shrieked out.
‘Come along, then.’ ‘Hold hard, Sir,’ said Sam, raising the barrow.
‘Come along,’ cried Wardle.
‘Come back!’ the Caterpillar called after her.
‘Come in!’ cried the little man.
‘Come in,’ said Arabella.
‘Come in,’ said a female voice.
‘Come on!’ said the cab-driver, sparring away like clockwork.
‘Come to take you home tomorrow,’ replied Benjamin.
‘Come — are you coming?’ I continued.
‘Come, come, there’s a good child,’ I whispered, leading him in.
‘Come, come,’ he said, ‘you are flurried, Mr. Lockwood.
‘Come, it’s pleased so far,’ thought Alice, and she went on.
‘Come, let’s try the first figure!’ said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon.
‘Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!’ thought Alice.
‘Come, then,’ he whispered earnestly.
‘Come, you look rather better now!’ she said, after altering most of the pins.
‘Come,’ said Wardle, ‘a song — a Christmas song!'
‘Coming down the yard now, Sir,’ replied the hostler.
‘Coming, Sir,’ replied Sam, running upstairs.
‘Consent to what?’ she asked.
‘Consider your verdict,’ he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.
‘Consider, Sir, consider.’ ‘I’ll not consider,’ replied Jingle.
‘Containing a position which I deny,’ interrupted he of the dirty countenance.
‘Contemplating the scene?’ inquired the dismal man.
‘Contrary!’ said a voice as sweet as a silver bell.
‘Count,’ said Mrs. Leo Hunter.
‘Country make,’ replied Sam.
‘Cuba for the Cubans’, is the watchword of the creoles.
‘Curious circumstance about those initials, sir,’ said Mr. Magnus.
‘Curious,’ said he, smacking his lips, ‘I hardly know, now.
‘Damn the curate, and thee!
‘Damned — thou saucy witch!’ he replied.
‘Dear man!’ said the spinster, as the door closed after him.
‘Dear me!’ exclaimed the old lady.
‘Dear me, no!’ said the King.
‘Dear old thing!’ said Arabella.
‘Delightful young man, his Lordship,’ said the Master of the Ceremonies.
‘Delightful, my dear Sir,’ replied the little man.
‘Devil of a mess on the staircase, waiter,’ said the stranger.
‘Devilish good — devilish good,’ said the man.
‘Did he though?’ inquired another cabman.
‘Did she come to Wuthering Heights because she hated you?’ I continued.
‘Did she say she was grieved?’ he inquired, looking very serious.
‘Did you say pig, or fig?’ said the Cat.
‘Did you say “What a pity!”?’ the Rabbit asked.
‘Did you speak’, he inquired, after an awful silence.
‘Digging for apples, indeed!’ said the Rabbit angrily.
‘Directly, sir,’ replied the waiter.
‘Ditto, ditto’ cried Tweedledee.
‘Do I look like it?’ he said.
‘Do be quiet, Payne,’ interposed the lieutenant.
‘Do nothing of the kind,’ said Jingle.
‘Do you know anything of this, Sam?’ he said sharply.
‘Do you know me, man?’ inquired the stranger angrily.
‘Do you know me?’ demanded the gentleman.
‘Do you remain here?’ inquired Mr. Nathaniel Winkle.
‘Do you stop here, sir?’ ‘I do,’ he said.
‘Does the boots and shoes!’ she repeated in a wondering tone.
‘Does the person want me, Sam?’ inquired Mr. Pickwick.
‘Don’t be frightened,’ said the host.
‘Don’t be so silly,’ I said to him.
‘Don’t go away, Mary,’ said the black-eyed man.
‘Don’t let him go alone!’ screamed the females.
‘Don’t let us quarrel,’ the White Queen said in an anxious tone.
‘Don’t trouble about an old creature like me.
‘Don’t trouble yourself,’ said Mr. Jackson.
‘Don’t you see?’ said Bob.
‘Double, single, and the rub.’ ‘Never was such luck,’ said Mr. Miller.
‘Drag her away!’ he cried, savagely.
‘Each with a lobster as a partner!’ it cried.
‘Eh!’ said Mr. Trotter, with a look of virtuous surprise.
‘Enough is as good as a feast,’ they say.
‘Everybody knows that,’ said the corpulent host.
‘Everything, my dear Sir,’ was the little man’s reply.
‘Exactly so,’ said Alice.
‘Except Mullins’s Meadows,’ observed the fat man solemnly.
‘Except Tom’s enemies,’ replied the bagman.
‘Excuse me,’ replied Magnus, standing on the wheel.
‘Far enough off, by this time,’ replied Wardle, coolly reloading his gun.
‘Faster!’ and dragged her along.
‘Father!’ cried he, recoiling in amazement.
‘Feather!’ cried the Sheep, as she took up another pair of needles.
‘Fiddle-de-dee’s not English,’ Alice replied gravely.
‘Fifteenth,’ said the March Hare.
‘Fill your glass, and pass the wine,’ said the indefatigable visitor.
‘Fine pursuit, sir — fine pursuit.
‘Fine,’ said Mr. Leo Hunter; ‘so simple.’
‘Fire away.’ Mr. Winkle advanced, and levelled his gun.
‘First and foremost, do you love Mr. Edgar?’
‘Fivepence farthing for one—Twopence for two,’ the Sheep replied.
‘For one hour,’ he pleaded earnestly.
‘For shame, young man!’ said the gentleman with the red nose.
‘For today we must part,’ she said.
‘Forgiveness!’ said Linton.
‘Forty-two,’ replied the driver, eyeing him.
‘Fourteenth of March, I think it was,’ he said.
‘Funny!’ he exclaimed involuntarily.
‘Get along with you!’ said Mrs. Weller, pushing him away.
‘Get off with ye!’ he growled, with uncompromising gruffness.
‘Get on your bonnet,’ repeated Wardle.
‘Get out of the way!’ cried the officers of the stationary one.
‘Get up, you idle boy!’ he exclaimed, with assumed heartiness.
‘Get your hat, Sam,’ he said.
‘Give me that key: I will have it!’ she said.
‘Give your evidence,’ said the King.
‘Go on, go on,’ almost shrieked the old gentleman.
‘Go on,’ said the judge.
‘Go!’ exclaimed the Dodger. ‘Why, where’s your spirit?’
‘God bless thee, darling!’ I cried, forgetting instantaneously my foolish fears.
‘Going outside?’ said the red-haired man.
‘Going to Ipswich, Sir?’ ‘I am,’ he replied.
‘Good hand at accounts,’ said Mr. Weller.
‘Good,’ he said, smacking his lips.
‘Good,’ said the stranger.
‘Good-bye!’ ‘Good-bye!’ said the housemaid.
‘Good-bye, Ellen!’ whispered my dear little mistress.
‘Good-bye, till we meet again!’ she said as cheerfully as she could.
‘Good-looking, too!’ whispered Emily Wardle.
‘Governor in?’ inquired Sam, in reply to the question.
‘Hadn’t they better go to bed, ma’am?’ inquired Emma.
‘Hallo there!’ he repeated.
‘Hallo!’ replied a faint voice from within the bedclothes.
‘Hallo!’ said the old gentleman.
‘Hallo!’ was the red-headed man’s reply.
‘Hallo!’ was the sound that roused him.
‘Hallo, Nelly!’ said Mr. Heathcliff, when he saw me.
‘Hand it over here,’ said the Dodo.
‘Hand it over,’ said the gentleman.
‘Hareton, it’s Nelly!
‘Have some wine,’ the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.
‘Have you been seeing any spirits?’ inquired the old gentleman.
‘Have you got everything?’ said Mr. Winkle, in an agitated tone.
‘Hay, then,’ the King murmured in a faint whisper.
‘He does not know his letters,’ he said to his cousin.
‘He had better have something to eat, immediately,’ remarked Emily.
‘He has kissed another,’ gasped the excited manager.
‘He has kissed one of ‘em!’ exclaimed the delighted little man.
‘He has shaken hands with the men,’ cried the little agent.
‘He is a dreadful reprobate,’ said Mrs. Weller.
‘He is just going to supper,’ replied the girl.
‘He is,’ said Mr. Allen.
‘He is,’ said the middle-aged lady.
‘He knows nothing of what has happened,’ he whispered.
‘He must have been fast asleep,’ whispered Mr. Tupman.
‘He must have imitated somebody else’s hand,’ said the King.
‘He sleeps,’ murmured the spinster aunt.
‘He told me to begone as fast as I could,’ she answered.
‘He took me for his housemaid,’ she said to herself as she ran.
‘He understands us, I see,’ said Arabella.
‘He wants Miss Tomkins.’ Here there was a general scream.
‘He wouldn’t look at me,’ replied the boy.
‘He-he-he,’ tittered Mr. Magnus, affecting cheerfulness, and gasping with agitation.
‘Heathcliff dead!’ I exclaimed, astonished.
‘Hello!’ repeated Sam, still more gruffly.
‘Hem!’ said Miss Wardle, rather dubiously.
‘Herald, read the accusation!’ said the King.
‘Here he is at last!’ said old Mr. Wardle.
‘Here he is!’ said Sam, rising with great glee.
‘Here is the entry,’ resumed Dodson.
‘Here it is,’ said the pretty housemaid.
‘Here!’ replied a feeble voice.
‘Here,’ said Mr. Pickwick.
‘Here’s a game!’ roared the populace.
‘Here’s a subpoena for you, Mr. Weller,’ said Jackson.
‘Here’s the original,’ said Jackson, declining the required explanation.
‘He’ll come to be scragged, won’t he?’
‘He’s married.’ ‘Married!’ exclaimed Pott, with frightful vehemence.
‘He’s, perhaps, dreaming now,’ she continued.
‘Hoi — hoi — hoi!’ was the only reply.
‘Hoi!’ shouted the officers of the advancing line.
‘Hold your tongue!’ cried the Tiger-lily.
‘Hold your tongue!’ it added, before Alice could speak again.
‘Honk!’ said the gander, and the geese obeyed the mysterious command.
‘Hope so,’ replied his companion.
‘How I should like to go,’ said Mr. Tupman again.
‘How am I to get in?’ asked Alice again, in a louder tone.
‘How are you?’ said the discomfited student.
‘How are you?’ said the old man, grasping Mr. Tupman’s hand.
‘How awkward you are,’ said the pretty housemaid.
‘How can I have done that?’ she thought.
‘How can she knit with so many?’ the puzzled child thought to herself.
‘How dare you tell me a falsehood?’ he said.
‘How did I do it?’ he inquired.
‘How do you know I’m mad?’ said Alice.
‘How dreadfully savage!’ exclaimed Alice.
‘How it snows!’ said one of the men, in a low tone.
‘How long they are!’ she exclaimed.
‘How long you have been!’ he said.
‘How long?’ ‘Ah!’ ‘Why, I don’t rightly know.
‘How must I arrange it, then?’ she asked despairingly.
‘How must I do?’ I continued, with rising irritation.
‘How should I know?’ said Alice, surprised at her own courage.
‘However, I know my name now.’ she said, ‘that’s some comfort’.
‘Hum — what’s that?’ said the strange man.
‘Hurrah!’ gasped Mr. Winkle faintly.
‘Hurrah!’ shouted the mob, in conclusion..
‘Hush!’ cried Mrs. Linton, 'hush, this moment!'
‘Hush!’ said Sam.
‘I ain’t drunk.’ ‘Then you’re mad; that’s worse'.
‘I am exceedingly sorry, ma’am,’ he said, bowing very low.
‘I am not aware of anything more,’ replied Mr. Winkle.
‘I am so sleepy?’ she moaned.
‘I am to be sworn, my Lord, am I?’ said the chemist.
‘I beg your pardon?’ said Alice.
‘I call him perfectly twee!’ persisted Phyllis.
‘I call it purring, not growling,’ said Alice.
‘I can,’ replied Mr. Pickwick.
‘I cannot deny it, Sir,’ said Arabella.
‘I cannot rest, Ellen,’ she said, by way of apology.
‘I can’t imagine,’ replied Mr. Winkle.
‘I can’t sit on a chair,’ sobbed the boy.
‘I can’t tell why we should stay.
‘I dare say it will,’ replied his friend dryly.
‘I deny it!’ said the March Hare.
‘I did not question him,’ I answered.
‘I didn’t take it,’ said Mr. Pickwick indignantly.
‘I didn’t!’ she cried, recovering her speech; ‘I did nothing deliberately.
‘I didn’t, my Lord,’ replied Mr. Winkle.
‘I do, indeed,’ replied the Doctor.
‘I don’t know what you mean,’ said Alice.
‘I don’t know what you mean,’ she said.
‘I don’t know, sir,’ replied the housemaid.
‘I don’t know,’ Alice said doubtfully.
‘I don’t know,’ I said.
‘I don’t know,’ he replied pettishly.
‘I don’t know,’ he replied, in the same tone.
‘I don’t know,’ he replied, with equal carelessness..
‘I don’t like this plan,’ said Mr. Pickwick, after deep meditation.
‘I don’t much care where—’ said Alice.
‘I don’t quite know yet,’ Alice said, very gently.
‘I don’t quite understand you,’ she said, as politely as she could.
‘I don’t see any wine,’ she remarked.
‘I entreat you to be quiet, Payne,’ said the other.
‘I expect him every instant, sir,’ said Arabella.
‘I fear I must,’ said Bob, with heroic firmness.
‘I have been hasty, too,’ said he.
‘I have been hasty,’ he said, ‘very hasty.
‘I have forgotten my flowers,’ said the spinster aunt.
‘I have met this gentleman before,’ said the Doctor, with marked emphasis.
‘I have no assistant, my Lord,’ said the chemist.
‘I have not had that pleasure, Sir,’ rejoined the landlord.
‘I have not the least doubt of it,’ replied the spinster aunt.
‘I have seen him,’ replied the middle-aged lady.
‘I have very particular business with him,’ said he.
‘I have,’ said the dismal man hurriedly.
‘I hope it is,’ said Wardle, with a short, dry cough.
‘I hope not,’ said Mr. Snodgrass.
‘I hope that’s Jack Hopkins!’ said Mr. Sawyer.
‘I hope you’re a good hand at pinning and tying strings?’ Tweedledum remarked.
‘I know it is,’ said Mr. Weller.
‘I let it off.’ ‘Well done'.
‘I like birthday presents best,’ she said at last.
‘I like them when they can talk,’ Alice said.
‘I mean what I say,’ the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone.
‘I merely want you to hear what this gentleman says,’ replied Dodson.
‘I must and shall!’ he replied in a subdued voice.
‘I must have two—to fetch and carry.
‘I must submit to you, Sir — ’ he said.
‘I must — Linton will be up immediately,’ persisted the alarmed intruder.
‘I must,’ replied Mary.
‘I never bet half a dozen!’ said the other.
‘I never saw one, or heard of one,’ said Alice.
‘I never thought of that before!’ she said.
‘I only hope the boat won’t tipple over!’ she said to herself.
‘I only meant that I didn’t understand,’ said Alice.
‘I only took the regular course.’
‘I only wish I had such eyes,’ the King remarked in a fretful tone.
‘I rather think it can be done,’ said the bustling little man.
‘I really think you had better,’ said Allen.
‘I said there was nothing like it.’ Which Alice did not venture to deny.
‘I see somebody now!’ she exclaimed at last.
‘I see you don’t,’ said Alice.
‘I shall be glad to have a cup,’ I answered.
‘I shall feel proud of your acquaintance, Sir,’ said the little doctor.
‘I shall go as a bandit,’ interposed Mr. Tupman.
‘I shall have my supper in another room,’ I said.
‘I shall require good bail,’ said the magistrate.
‘I shall think it a dream tomorrow!’ she cried.
‘I should be sorry to think so,’ returned his companion.
‘I should like to buy an egg, please,’ she said timidly.
‘I should like to have it explained,’ said the Mock Turtle.
‘I should like to have seen that dog,’ said Mr. Winkle.
‘I should like to hear her try and repeat something now.
‘I should like to see his poem,’ said Mr. Snodgrass.
‘I should think so,’ replied Sam, with a patronising wink.
‘I should win easy,’ said the Lion.
‘I suppose so,’ said Alice.
‘I suppose you don’t even know what a prig is?’ said the Dodger mournfully.
‘I suppose your master’s very rich?’ said Sam.
‘I surprise you, I see, ma’am,’ said the old gentleman.
‘I swear Linton is dying,’ repeated Heathcliff, looking hard at me.
‘I talk English, don’t I?’ the Frog went on.
‘I think I may as well go in at once.’ And in she went.
‘I think it is, Sam,’ said he.
‘I think it’s quite impossible to go on tonight,’ interposed Ben.
‘I think we may adjourn,’ said the Lieutenant.
‘I think you had better, sir,’ whispered Jinks to the magistrate.
‘I thought it had been your cousin Hareton,’ I observed to Catherine.
‘I thought it would,’ said the Cat, and vanished again.
‘I thought you did,’ replied the old gentleman, with indignant emphasis.
‘I thought you did,’ said the Mouse.
‘I wants to make your flesh creep,’ replied the boy.
‘I was coming to that,’ the Knight said.
‘I was out last night with my master,’ replied the stranger.
‘I was,’ said Mr. Pickwick.
‘I will consider,’ replied the old gentleman.
‘I will, father,’ he panted.
‘I will,’ said the aunt.
‘I wish I had the vagabonds here,’ said the captain wrathfully.
‘I wish I knew!’ thought poor Alice.
‘I wish she felt as I do,’ he replied: ‘spiteful, cruel thing!
‘I wish you would repeat it, Sir,’ he said.
‘I wish you’d come and see me,’ said Bob Sawyer.
‘I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?’ she said aloud.
‘I wonder if all the things move along with us?’ thought poor puzzled Alice.
‘I wonder whether he’s disengaged now?’ said Jackson.
‘I won’t be held!’ cried the old man.
‘I won’t!’ said Alice.
‘I — I — really think they are,’ urged Mr. Snodgrass, somewhat alarmed.
‘I!’ exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.
‘If I’d meant that, I’d have said it,’ said Humpty Dumpty.
‘If!’ exclaimed the old man, with a look of excessive contempt.
‘Impossible,’ replied Mr. Pickwick.
‘Indeed I did,’ said Alice: ‘you’ve said it very often—and very loud.
‘Indeed!’ said Mr. Winkle.
‘Informers!’ shouted the crowd again.
‘Instantly, sir,’ said the lady.
‘Is Mrs. Dean within?’ I demanded of the dame.
‘Is anything the matter?’ inquired the three ladies.
‘Is he a ghoul or a vampire?’ I mused.
‘Is he not a handsome lad?’ he continued.
‘Is he to have any?’ she asked, appealing to Heathcliff.
‘Is it half-an-hour now, Ellen?’ she whispered in my ear, at last.
‘Is it possible?’ said Mr. Tupman.
‘Is it worth keeping?’ I inquired, less sulkily.
‘Is nothing to be said to me?’ he cried, with open arms.
‘Is she alone?’ inquired the old gentleman.
‘Is she gone?’ I said.
‘Is she?’ said Mr. Pickwick.
‘Is that all?’ Alice timidly asked.
‘Is that all?’ said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she could.
‘Is that the reason so many tea-things are put out here?’ she asked.
‘Is that you, Sam?’ he inquired, springing out of bed.
‘Is the fool drunk?’ asked Mr. Heathcliff.
‘Is there anybody in the kitchen?’ Not a soul.
‘Is this Bury St. Edmunds?’ ‘It is,’ he replied.
‘Is this the room?’ murmured the little gentleman.
‘Isn’t he a lovely sight?’ said Tweedledum.
‘It all came different!’ the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully.
‘It all lies in a nutshell my dear; in a nutshell.'
‘It always happens,’ said the gnat.
‘It began with blotting paper,’ the Knight answered with a groan.
‘It began with the tea,’ the Hatter replied.
‘It can talk,’ said he, solemnly.
‘It can’t be anybody else!’ she said to herself.
‘It does the boots and shoes,’ it replied very solemnly.
‘It gets easier further on,’ Humpty Dumpty replied.
‘It is late!’ he said, speaking short and with difficulty.
‘It is nothing, is it, Ellen Dean?’ he said sternly.
‘It is striking four,’ I answered.
‘It is them,’ exclaimed Wardle.
‘It is well you are out of my reach,’ he exclaimed.
‘It is,’ replied the host.
‘It isn't poetry, is it?’ interposed his father.
‘It isn’t mine,’ said the Hatter.
‘It isn’t respectable to beg,’ said the King.
‘It must be a very pretty dance,’ said Alice timidly.
‘It proves nothing of the sort!’ said Alice.
‘It runs thus,’ said the grave man, still more gravely.
‘It sounds like a horse,’ Alice thought to herself.
‘It was all kinds of fastness with me, I can assure you!’ he said.
‘It was because you disliked Mr. Heathcliff,’ she answered.
‘It was the best butter,’ the March Hare meekly replied.
‘It's mine,’ I said. ‘They took the con.’
‘It’s a fabulous monster!’ the Unicorn cried out, before Alice could reply.
‘It’s a shame,’ said the bodyguard reproachfully.
‘It’s all over!’ thought Mr. Pickwick.
‘It’s all ready,’ said he, offering the pistol.
‘It’s exactly like a riddle with no answer!’ she thought.
‘It’s like a dream,’ ejaculated Mr. Pickwick, ‘a hideous dream'.
‘It’s naughty, ain’t it, Oliver?’ inquired Charley Bates
‘It’s of no use,’ said Mr. Tupman.
‘It’s only the Red King snoring,’ said Tweedledee.
‘It’s quite dreadful,’ he said, stopping his ears.
‘It’s really dreadful,’ she muttered to herself, ‘the way all the creatures argue’.
‘It’s so unsportsmanlike,’ reasoned Winkle.
‘It’s some damnable writing,’ he answered.
‘It’s very unfortunate,’ said the stranger, with a sigh.
‘It’s—it’s a very fine day!’ said a timid voice at her side.
‘I’d rather see that done on paper,’ he said.
‘I’ll be here next Thursday,’ she cried, springing to the saddle.
‘I’ll call him,’ I replied.
‘I’ll dance with the widow,’ said the stranger.
‘I’ll fetch the executioner myself,’ said the King eagerly, and he hurried off.
‘I’ll get one,’ the Knight said thoughtfully to himself.
‘I’ll go with him as far as the park,’ he said.
‘I’ll go with him,’ said Mr. Pickwick.
‘I’ll see,’ said Wicks, dismounting leisurely from his stool.
‘I’ll step out by and by, Mary.
‘I’ll tell you how I came to think of it,’ said the Knight.
‘I’m a poor man, your Majesty,’ he began.
‘I’m delighted to hear it,’ he said, rubbing his hands.
‘I’m done for, my lass!’ he said, looking at me.
‘I’m glad I’ve seen that done,’ thought Alice.
‘I’m nearly distracted, Nelly!’ she exclaimed, throwing herself on the sofa.
‘I’m not a mile high,’ said Alice.
‘I’m not a serpent!’ said Alice indignantly.
‘I’m not a visitor, and I’m not a servant.
‘I’m not offended,’ said Humpty Dumpty.
‘I’m not so sure of that,’ said the Unicorn.
‘I’m sure I have been a good mistress to you, Joe.
‘I’m very far from jesting, Miss Catherine,’ I replied.
‘I’m very unhappy!’ ‘A pity,’ observed I.
‘I’ve got it!’ she cried in a triumphant tone.
‘I’ve tied his tongue,’ observed Heathcliff.
‘Jingle,’ said that versatile gentleman, taking the hint at once.
‘Just come in, Sir,’ replied Jackson.
‘Just so, Sir,’ replied Mr. Jinks.
‘Keep your temper,’ said the Caterpillar.
‘Keep yourself up for an instant — for only one instant!’ bawled Mr. Snodgrass.
‘Ladies and gentlemen,’ he said, suddenly rising.
‘Lady and gentleman?’ inquired Wardle, almost breathless with impatience.
‘Leave off that!’ screamed the Queen.
‘Leave the room!’ he said, glaring upon the bewildered youth.
‘Leave the room, Ellen!’ she repeated, trembling all over.
‘Let me have them, and I’ll send you a cheque.
‘Let me lead you downstairs,’ said the ever-gallant Mr. Tupman.
‘Let me out,’ cried Mr. Pickwick.
‘Let me see,’ said the legal authority.
‘Let us celebrate this happy meeting with a convivial glass,’ said he.
‘Little humbugs,’ he replied, deeply affected.
‘Look there!’ he said.
‘Look, look!’ she cried, pointing eagerly.
‘Lord, brother!’ said Miss Wardle, with a deprecating smile.
‘Married,’ repeated the old lady.
‘Men are such deceivers,’ she softly whispered.
‘Miss Rachael,’ roared the fat boy.
‘Miss is dreadfully wayward, sir,’ I called out.
‘Missed fire,’ said Mr. Winkle, who was very pale — probably from disappointment.
‘Missus!’ shouted the boy.
‘Most extraordinary female this,’ he thought, popping in again.
‘Much use that,’ growled the fat gentleman.
‘Mullins’s Meadows!’ ejaculated the other, with profound contempt..
‘Must a name mean something?’ Alice asked doubtfully.
‘Must not be continued, then,’ I said.
‘My dear Sir,’ remonstrated the little man.
‘My dear Sir,’ urged the little man.
‘My dear, it’s not my fault,’ said the gentleman.
‘My dear,’ said Mr. Pott, ‘I’m very sorry'.
‘My father!’ he cried, in strange perplexity.
‘My friend, Sir, Mr. Snodgrass,’ said Mr. Winkle, as the officer approached.
‘My papa scorns yours!’ cried Linton.
‘Nay!’ he snarled, or rather screamed through his nose.
‘Nay, don’t!’ I entreated.
‘Nay,’ he replied, looking down, and blushing bashfully.
‘Nearly there!’ the Queen repeated.
‘Nearly two miles high,’ added the Queen.
‘Never mind!’ I answered, tartly.
‘Never mind!’ said the King, with an air of great relief.
‘Never mind, sir,’ replied Mr. Magnus, striding up and down the room.
‘Never mind,’ replied his companion, ‘it will soon be over'.
‘Never mind,’ replied the old lady, with great dignity.
‘Never mind,’ said Wardle, after a short pause.
‘Never was such cards,’ said the fat gentleman.
‘Never!’ said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke.
‘Never!’ was the valorous reply.
‘Never, ma’am — never,’ said Goodwin.
‘No more it has,’ said Charley.
‘No other, ma’am,’ he replied, bowing very low.
‘No use, no use!’ said the King.
‘No warm water!’ exclaimed Mr. Bob Sawyer.
‘No — never!’ replied the astonished Mr. Pickwick.
‘No!’ rejoined Sam triumphantly.
‘No!’ she replied, peremptorily.
‘No!’ she shrieked.
‘No, I don’t think it is,’ he said: ‘at least—not under here’.
‘No, I don’t, Sir,’ replied the man civilly.
‘No, I have not,’ replied the clerk.
‘No, I shall be your companion there,’ I said.
‘No, I’ll not promise,’ I repeated.
‘No, Mr. Lockwood,’ said Nelly, shaking her head.
‘No, Nelly, I have not,’ he answered.
‘No, Sir,’ he replied, drawing Arabella’s arm through his.
‘No, he ain’t,’ said Mr. Grundy.
‘No, it ain’t,’ said the groom.
‘No, it can’t,’ said the Queen.
‘No, no — it’s over now,’ he said.
‘No, no!’ said the Queen.
‘No, no, no,’ added Emily hastily.
‘No, no,’ he interrupted, ‘the fault was mine.
‘No, no,’ murmured the spinster aunt; ‘I am better now'.
‘No, no,’ said Mr. Tupman, rising; ‘it will do me good'.
‘No, not all of you,’ said the strange man emphatically.
‘No, papa!’ she gasped.
‘No, she’s a sly one,’ he remarked, shaking his head.
‘No, sir, I haven’t,’ replied the boy.
‘No, sir,’ she replied timidly.
‘No, sir.’ ‘Then listen, if you please.
‘No, thank you,’ replied Mr. Winkle hurriedly.
‘No, that won’t do,’ I said.
‘No, to Wuthering Heights,’ he answered.
‘No, you don’t understand,’ the Knight said, looking a little vexed.
‘No,’ I said, half smiling.
‘No,’ answered Catherine.
‘No,’ he answered.
‘No,’ said Catherine; ‘unless in dreams'.
‘No,’ said Linton, with a gaze of vacant fear.
‘No,’ said the Caterpillar.
‘No,’ was the muttered reply.
‘Nobody said you did,’ said the Red Queen.
‘Nobody,’ said the messenger.
‘Nonsense!’ said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was silent.
‘Nor I,’ said the March Hare.
‘Nor anything at all, then, my lady?’ I said.
‘Not I!’ he replied.
‘Not above three-quarters of an hour,’ was everybody’s reply.
‘Not at all,’ gruffly remarked the elder man.
‘Not at all,’ said the King.
‘Not at your command!’ retorted Hareton.
‘Not exactly,’ said Sam.
‘Not for one minute,’ she replied.
‘Not much,’ said Mr. Winkle, rubbing his back very hard.
‘Not so well,’ he replied.
‘Not the man!’ said Mr. Snodgrass.
‘Not the man!’ said the gentleman with the camp-stool in his hand.
‘Not the slightest fear, Sir,’ interposed the hostler.
‘Not without sneezing,’ replied Sam.
‘Not yet, not yet!’ the Rabbit hastily interrupted.
‘Not yet,’ said the Knight.
‘Not you!’ Tweedledee retorted contemptuously.
‘Nothing can be fairer,’ he observed.
‘Nothing like it,’ replied his father.
‘Nothing more to arrange, I think,’ said the officer.
‘Nothing now.’ ‘Very good, sir'.
‘Nothing the matter, ma’am,’ replied the stranger.
‘Nothing the matter,’ he replied.
‘Nothing whatever,’ said Alice.
‘Nothing whatever?’ persisted the King.
‘Nothing!’ Alice said impatiently.
‘Nothing!’ said the lady, looking up.
‘Nothing, my dear boy, nothing,’ said Ben.
‘Nothing,’ said Alice.
‘Nothing,’ said the spinster aunt.
‘Nothin’ at all, Sir,’ replied his attendant.
‘Now he is here,’ I exclaimed.
‘Now we must sit close,’ said the stout gentleman.
‘Now!’ cried the Queen.
‘Now, Kitty!’ she cried, clapping her hands triumphantly.
‘Now, Mr. Winkle,’ said the host, reloading his own gun.
‘Now, leave this house instantly!’ said Wardle, starting up.
‘Now, my dear sir — my dear sir,’ interposed the busy little man.
‘Now, who is that?’ asked Mr. Heathcliff, turning to Cathy.
‘Now, you go!’ he said to Earnshaw.
‘Now,’ he said, ‘sit down'.
‘No’, said the clergyman, and pivoted on his heel.
‘Observe this’ said the disconcerted officer, gasping for breath.
‘Odd,’ said the old gentleman, taking the gun.
‘Of course I do,’ he replied.
‘Of course they will,’ replied Mr. Winkle indignantly.
‘Of course twinkling begins with a T!’ said the King sharply.
‘Of course you agree to have a battle?’ Tweedledum said in a calmer tone.
‘Of course you don’t!’ the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously.
‘Of course you know the alternative,’ replied the visitor coolly.
‘Of course — he has ordered me to take him,’ I replied.
‘Of course,’ replied Bob.
‘Of course,’ said Mr. Snodgrass.
‘Of course,’ the Dodo replied very gravely.
‘Off directly,’ said the unabashed Jingle.
‘Off with her head!’ the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.
‘Off with his head!’ she said, without even looking round.
‘Oh dear, yes, quite,’ replied Bob.
‘Oh — you remember me, I suppose?’ he asked.
‘Oh!’ he sobbed, ‘I cannot bear it!
‘Oh!’ said Mr. Winkle, rising, ‘some friends of mine — show them in'.
‘Oh, Catherine!’ I cried, sorrowfully.
‘Oh, Edgar, Edgar!’ she panted, flinging her arms round his neck.
‘Oh, ah, I forgot that,’ he said.
‘Oh, certainly,’ replied Mr. Winkle.
‘Oh, certainly.’ By this time they had reached the road.
‘Oh, dear!’ she cried at last.
‘Oh, decidedly,’ observed the spinster aunt.
‘Oh, do, please’ cried all the ladies.
‘Oh, don’t talk about trouble!’ said the Duchess.
‘Oh, fie, silly child!’ I exclaimed.
‘Oh, he is, is he?’ said Sam.
‘Oh, he’ll catch his death of cold,’ said Emily.
‘Oh, hush!’ the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone.
‘Oh, it will be something worse,’ she said.
‘Oh, it’s too bad!’ she cried.
‘Oh, no, Sir,’ replied Mary eagerly.
‘Oh, nonsense, don’t talk to me,’ said Mrs. Pott.
‘Oh, she’s gone away,’ said the old gentleman.
‘Oh, there can’t be any doubt about it,’ rejoined Mrs. Sanders.
‘Oh, yes, I did!’ replied Mr. Tupman; ‘repeat them'.
‘Oh, you can’t help that,’ said the Cat: ‘we’re all mad here’.
‘Oh, you foolish Alice!’ she answered herself.
‘Oh, you sing,’ it said.
‘Oh, you’ve come back, have you!’ said Mrs. Weller.
‘Oh,’ he cried, ‘I shan’t tell you where it is'.
‘One, indeed!’ said the Dormouse indignantly.
‘Only a month or so,’ replied Mr. Bob Sawyer.
‘Only a thimble,’ said Alice sadly.
‘Only in the usual way,’ Alice said, smiling.
‘Only to start the game,’ replied Mr. Wardle, laughing.
‘Only you must eat them both, if you buy two,’ said the Sheep.
‘Open the bag!’ he whispered.
‘Open the window,’ said the sick man.
‘Or both,’ said Mr. Tupman.
‘Or drunk,’ said Mr. Winkle.
‘Papa told me; and papa does not tell falsehoods,’ she answered pertly.
‘Perhaps you looked at me?’ ‘Oh, no!
‘Perhaps you would like to call us swindlers, sir,’ said Dodson.
‘Person’s a-waiting,’ said Sam, epigrammatically.
‘Pickwick,’ said Mr. Tupman; ‘come up here'.
‘Play!’ suddenly cried the bowler.
‘Please, would you tell me what you call yourself?’ she said timidly.
‘Please, would you tell me—’ she began, looking timidly at the Red Queen.
‘Poor Hindley!’ I exclaimed, involuntarily.
‘Pray don’t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,’ said Alice.
‘Pretty busy, eh?’ said the little man.
‘Punch, I think, sir,’ replied Wilkins.
‘Quite aware of the fact, Sir,’ replied the fat gentleman sharply.
‘Quite impossible,’ said Mr. Snodgrass.
‘Quite out of the question,’ observed Benjamin Allen.
‘Quite right,’ said the King: ‘this young lady saw him too’.
‘Quite,’ replied Mr. Pickwick.
‘Quite,’ responded Mr. Winkle.
‘Rapid progress’ was his very words.
‘Rather, I confess,’ replied Arabella, wondering more and more.
‘Red-nosed chap?’ inquired Mr. Weller.
‘Regular good land that,’ interposed another fat man.
‘Remorse and misery,’ replied the stranger.
‘Repeat, “You are old, Father William,”’ said the Caterpillar.
‘Ring the alarm bell, somebody!’ cried a dozen voices.
‘Room for you all, gentlemen,’ said the stout man.
‘Rough weather!’ I remarked.
‘Rum creatures, women,’ said the dirty-faced man, after a pause.
‘Rum old girl,’ said Mr. Jingle, as he walked down the passage.
‘Sam!’ said Mr. Pickwick, calling over the banisters.
‘Sam,’ he said, looking out from under the bedclothes.
‘Samuel Weller?’ said Mr. Jackson, inquiringly.
‘Sap and sawdust,’ said the gnat.
‘Say he dreamt it,’ replied Mr. Jingle coolly.
‘Seems so,’ observed Sam.
‘Send the landlord,’ said the stranger.
‘Serpent!’ screamed the Pigeon.
‘Service is over,’ I announced.
‘Seven years and six months!’ Humpty Dumpty repeated thoughtfully.
‘Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?’ it went on.
‘Shan’t,’ said the cook.
‘Shaving-water, Sam,’ he said, from within the curtains.
‘She boxed the Queen’s ears—’ the Rabbit began.
‘She can’t do addition,’ the Red Queen interrupted.
‘She can’t explain it,’ it said hastily.
‘She has a crush on our military chauffeur,’ said the doctor.
‘She has blood on her lips!’ he said, shuddering.
‘She!’ said the old gentleman, with a knowing shake of the head.
‘She’s a fine creature,’ said Mr. Magnus.
‘She’s all right again now,’ said the Red Queen.
‘She’s coming!’ cried the Larkspur.
‘She’s fainted, or dead,’ I thought: ‘so much the better'.
‘She’s grown a good deal!’ was her first remark.
‘She’s my prisoner, you know!’ the Red Knight said at last.
‘She’s tired, poor thing!’ said the Red Queen.
‘Shout with the largest,’ he replied.
‘Show the gentlemen into the parlour, Tom,’ said the landlady.
‘Show your ticket, child!’ the Guard went on, looking angrily at Alice.
‘Silence!’ I interrupted.
‘Silence!’ he exclaimed.
‘Silence!’ roared the mayor’s attendants.
‘Sit down, sir,’ he said, at length.
‘Sit down,’ said the young man, gruffly.
‘Sit still, Mrs. Dean,’ I cried; ‘do sit still another half-hour'.
‘Sixteenth,’ added the Dormouse.
‘Snows, does it?’ said Wardle.
‘So I should think,’ he rejoined drily.
‘So I was,’ he said.
‘So cheerful he is!’ said Sam.
‘So have I,’ said the stranger.
‘So it is — so it is, old fellow,’ replied Wardle.
‘So make haste, Ellen!’ she cried.
‘So much humour,’ said Sam.
‘So much obliged!’ added Tweedledee.
‘So should I,’ said Mr. Tupman, speaking for the first time.
‘Some more toast - buttered toast, mind,’ said the gentleman fiercely.
‘Some one mistress does not expect,’ I replied.
‘Something in the yard,’ replied the stranger.
‘Sound philosopher,’ said Mr. Pott.
‘Speak lower, Mary — What is the matter?’ said Mr. Linton.
‘Speak when you’re spoken to!’ The Queen sharply interrupted her.
‘Speak, can’t you?’ he cried impatiently.
‘Speak, won’t you!’ cried the King.
‘Spirited contest, my dear sir,’ said the little man.
‘Stand up and repeat “‘Tis the voice of the sluggard,”’ it said.
‘Stay one minute,’ I began.
‘Stay, Mr. Jingle!’ said the spinster aunt emphatically.
‘Stop a bit,’ replied Sam, suddenly recollecting himself.
‘Stop!’ cried his father.
‘Stop!’ he said, after they had gone a few yards farther.
‘Stop!’ he said, arresting her by the arm.
‘Stop, my good friend!’ I cried.
‘Strange!’ said the little old man.
‘Stuff and nonsense!’ said Alice loudly.
‘Suppose we change the subject,’ the March Hare interrupted, yawning.
‘Supposing it couldn’t find any?’ she suggested.
‘Surely you did not hear them!’ she said bashfully.
‘Swear the gentleman,’ said the judge peremptorily.
‘Swim after them!’ it screamed.
‘Take a bone from a dog: what remains?’ Alice considered.
‘Take care!’ cried Alice.
‘Take him up, Joe,’ said the old gentleman.
‘Take his skates off,’ he repeated firmly.
‘Take it,’ he added, thrusting the tray into my hand.
‘Take my colt, Gipsy, then!’ said young Earnshaw.
‘Take off your hat,’ the King said to the Hatter.
‘Talk of your German universities,’ said the little old man.
‘Thank you very much,’ said Alice.
‘Thank you, sir — thank you’ she exclaimed hysterically.
‘Thank you,’ replied Mr. Winkle.
‘Thank you,’ said Alice, ‘it’s very interesting’.
‘That I can’t remember,’ said the Hatter.
‘That accounts for the bleeding, you see,’ she said to Alice with a smile.
‘That is not true!’ exclaimed Linton, rising in agitation.
‘That proves his guilt,’ said the Queen.
‘That reptile!’ he replied.
‘That seems to be done right—’ he began.
‘That’s a clincher,’ said Mr. Weller, aside.
‘That’s a very gratifying reflection, Sam,’ he said approvingly.
‘That’s all,’ said Humpty Dumpty.
‘That’s an unanswerable reason, anyhow,’ said Bob.
‘That’s good sound argument,’ said the placid man.
‘That’s hardly enough,’ he said, anxiously.
‘That’s it,’ said the old gentleman.
‘That’s just what I complain of,’ said Humpty Dumpty.
‘That’s none of your business, Two!’ said Seven.
‘That’s right!’ I said to myself.
‘That’s right!’ said the Tiger-lily.
‘That’s right!’ shouted the Queen.
‘That’s the time,’ thought he, getting cautiously onto his feet.
‘That’s too high,’ murmured the provoking thing.
‘That’s very curious!’ she thought.
‘That’s very extraordinary,’ said the mottled-faced man.
‘That’s very important,’ the King said, turning to the jury.
‘The Lieutenant,’ said Mr. Winkle.
‘The cobbler nodded.
‘The commonest occurrence startles her painfully,’ I said.
‘The consequences may be dreadful,’ said Mr. Winkle.
‘The daisies are worst of all.
‘The dead letters, of course,’ said the bagman.
‘The doctor, I believe, is a very good shot,’ said Mr. Winkle.
‘The fact is — ’ said Sam, stopping short.
‘The licence!’ said Rachael, blushing.
‘The night through,’ he repeated.
‘The press is a mighty engine, sir,’ said Pott.
‘Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!’ the soldiers shouted in reply.
‘Then begin at once,’ said Wardle.
‘Then if the dog went away, its temper would remain!’ the Queen exclaimed triumphantly.
‘Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,’ said the Cat.
‘Then it ought to be Number One,’ said Alice.
‘Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,’ said Alice angrily.
‘Then the Dormouse shall!’ they both cried.
‘Then you are not afraid of death?’ I pursued.
‘Then you should say what you mean,’ the March Hare went on.
‘There is a man in the passage now,’ said Mr. Tupman.
‘There is an inscription here,’ he said.
‘There is no air here,’ said the man faintly.
‘There is no date to that, is there?’ inquired a juror.
‘There is nothing in the world the matter,’ I whispered.
‘There isn’t any,’ said the March Hare.
‘There was more scope for imagination,’ she said.
‘There’s a barrow t’other side of the hedge,’ said the boy.
‘There’s a gate here,’ replied old Wardle.
‘There’s a good name before it, too, you will observe.
‘There’s my lodgings,’ said Mr. Bob Sawyer, producing a card.
‘There’s nobody here!’ I insisted.
‘There’s nothing but hay left now,’ the Messenger said, peeping into the bag.
‘There’s nothing the matter but laziness; is there, Earnshaw?’ he said.
‘There’s the officer,’ exclaimed Mr. Winkle, after a few minutes walking.
‘These are the earliest flowers at the Heights,’ she exclaimed.
‘They are going to the Grange, then?’ I said.
‘They are great scoundrels,’ he said.
‘They are here,’ added the count, tapping his forehead significantly.
‘They are not worth your notice,’ said the dismal man.
‘They are very like their mamma, Sir,’ said Mr. Pott, majestically.
‘They are, they are,’ ejaculated Mr. Tupman; ‘but not all men'.
‘They lived on treacle,’ said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or two.
‘They must be townspeople,’ said the magistrate.
‘They’ll turn up presently, I dare say.
‘Thinking again?’ the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp little chin.
‘This is a most extraordinary request,’ said the magistrate.
‘This is insufferable!’ he exclaimed.
‘This is it, ain’t it?’ ‘Let me look,’ said Sam.
‘This is the room, is it?’ said the gentleman.
‘This is very curious,’ he thought.
‘This is very strange,’ he said.
‘This is your room, sir,’ said the chambermaid.
‘This matter is growing alarming,’ he reasoned with himself.
‘This,’ replied Jackson, shaking the parchment.
‘This,’ said he, ‘determines me'.
‘Three hundred and sixty-five,’ said Alice.
‘Throw some cold water over her,’ said the old gentleman.
‘Tickets, please!’ said the Guard, putting his head in at the window.
‘Time — for what?’ said the spinster aunt coquettishly.
‘To answer the door?’ he said.
‘To be sure I do.’ said Alice.
‘To guard against the bites of sharks,’ the Knight replied.
‘To hear you, people might think you were the mistress!’ she cried.
‘To oblige me, you will,’ he resumed.
‘To the Angel at Bury,’ he replied, speaking very quickly.
‘To the bottom of the park,’ she stammered.
‘To what?’ inquired Mr. Pickwick.
‘Tomorrow!’ exclaimed his admiring followers.
‘Too proud?’ the other inquired.
‘Traitor!’ thought the spinster aunt.
‘Treacle,’ said a sleepy voice behind her.
‘Treacle,’ said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.
‘True, true,’ said the stout gentleman; ‘no one can deny it'.
‘Turn a somersault in the sea!’ cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly about.
‘Tut, tut, child!’ said the Duchess.
‘Twelve pounds a year,’ he replied.
‘Two makes us eight,’ said Mr. Pickwick.
‘Two or three weeks,’ replied the man.
‘Understanding!’ such a coarse word!
‘Very good,’ said the magistrate, signing the warrants.
‘Very likely, ma’am,’ said the magistrate.
‘Very likely,’ replied Sam briefly.
‘Very much indeed,’ said Alice.
‘Very sorry!’ said the furious magistrate.
‘Very sorry,’ said the crestfallen Miller.
‘Very true,’ said the Duchess: ‘flamingoes and mustard both bite’.
‘Very well!’ shouted Joseph, as he slowly drew off.
‘Very well, Miss!’ I exclaimed, concealing my joy under an angry countenance.
‘Very well, my Lord,’ replied the chemist, in a resigned manner.
‘Very well, sir,’ replied the waiter.
‘Very well,’ he replied, looking round him.
‘Very well,’ said the magistrate.
‘Very!’ said Mr. Tupman.
‘Very,’ said Alice: ‘—where’s the Duchess?’
‘Very,’ said Bob Sawyer, with his mouth full.
‘Very,’ said Dodson, opening the door.
‘Very,’ said his fellow-voyagers.
‘Very,’ said the gentleman with the camp-stool.
‘Wages?’ inquired Sam.
‘Waiter,’ said the gentleman with the whiskers.
‘Wake up, Dormouse!’ And they pinched it on both sides at once.
‘Wash away your spleen,’ he said.
‘Watch ‘em,’ said Jingle.
‘Water them now,’ said Mr. Tupman, in accents of persuasion.
‘We wanted to plant some flowers there,’ she cried.
‘We were trespassing, it seems,’ said Wardle.
‘Weeks!’ said Mr. Pickwick in astonishment, and out came the note-book again.
‘Well then, good-night,’ he said, attempting to disengage his hand.
‘Well!’ said Mr. Pickwick.
‘Well!’ said Mr. Weller to himself, as the man approached.
‘Well, Ellen, I’m so afraid of you being angry,’ she said.
‘Well, I think it is,’ said Mr. Wardle.
‘Well, I’ll tell you something!’ said Linton.
‘Well, Joe,’ said the trembling old lady.
‘Well, Wilkins, what’s the matter with you?’ said the Captain.
‘Well, close the curtains, Nelly,’ she said; ‘and bring up tea'.
‘Well, gentlemen,’ said the stout man, ‘very glad to see you'.
‘Well, here’s a game!’ cried Sam.
‘Well, is he coming?’ cried Catherine, when her cousin returned.
‘Well, it don’t much matter.
‘Well, it’s no use talking about it now,’ said Sam.
‘Well, my dear sir — you don’t take snuff!
‘Well, only on Thursdays,’ said the Queen.
‘Well, shake hands, won’t you?’ said Sam, disparagingly.
‘Well, then, he won’t,’ retorted Mr. Grundy.
‘Well, this is grand!’ said Alice.
‘Well, upon that understanding I’ll tell you,’ replied the traveller.
‘Well, well, I will,’ said Mr. Tupman.
‘Well, well,’ cried her husband, crossly, ‘don’t strangle me for that!'
‘Well, you look rosy enough, my young friend,’ he said.
‘Well,’ cried Mr. Jingle.
‘Well,’ said I, ‘where are your moor-game, Miss Cathy?'
‘Well,’ said Mr. Weller, ‘the advantage of the plan’s obvious.
‘Well,’ said Sam, ‘I am glad to hear it.
‘Well—yes—a little,’ Alice replied gently.
‘Were you asked?’ she repeated.
‘We’d better take it with us,’ the Knight said.
‘We’re in time,’ exclaimed Wardle.
‘We’re sure to catch them, I think,’ said he.
‘What a curious helmet you’ve got!’ she said cheerfully.
‘What a funny watch!’ she remarked.
‘What a number of cucumber-frames there must be!’ thought Alice.
‘What a pity it is he isn’t a prig!’
‘What a shocking scene!’ said the spinster aunt.
‘What a snob I am,’ he thought; ‘always bragging of home’.
‘What a thick black cloud that is!’ she said.
‘What ails your young lady?’ ‘She’s gone, she’s gone!
‘What are these lads for?’ inquired Mr. Pickwick abruptly.
‘What are they doing now?’ inquired Mr. Pickwick, adjusting his spectacles.
‘What are they doing?’ Alice whispered.
‘What are ye for?’ he shouted.
‘What are you doing there, Nelly?’ ‘My work, Miss,’ I replied.
‘What are you laughing at, Mr. Jinks?’ said the magistrate.
‘What can all that green stuff be?’ said Alice.
‘What did he say his name was?’ asked the captain.
‘What did he say his name was?’ whispered Wicks.
‘What did he say?’ asked Hareton.
‘What did she say?’ inquired Bob eagerly.
‘What did you take it for, then?’ inquired the cabman.
‘What do I want with yours?’ I retorted.
‘What do you call yourself?’ the Fawn said at last.
‘What do you know about this business?’ the King said to Alice.
‘What do you mean by that observation, Sir?’ inquired Mr. Winkle, angrily.
‘What do you say?’ demanded the master.
‘What do you want here, scoundrels?’ said Mr. Snodgrass.
‘What does he teach you?’ I asked.
‘What does it matter where my body happens to be?’ he said.
‘What else have you got in your pocket?’ he went on, turning to Alice.
‘What fun!’ it said, half to itself, half to Alice.
‘What impertinence!’ said the pudding.
‘What is it, now?’ the Frog said in a deep hoarse whisper.
‘What is it?’ inquired Ben Allen carelessly.
‘What is it?’ inquired Ben Allen, interrupting him with some impatience.
‘What is the fun?’ said Alice.
‘What is the matter, my little man?’ I asked.
‘What is the matter?’ he said to the boy.
‘What is the name of the house?’ he inquired.
‘What is this?’ he said at last.
‘What kind of compromise would you recommend?’ he inquired.
‘What names, sir?’ said the man at the door.
‘What place is this?’ she inquired, pausing.
‘What shall I do!’ said the poor spinster, bursting into tears.
‘What should ail them?’ he said.
‘What size do you want to be?’ it asked.
‘What sort of things do you remember best?’ Alice ventured to ask.
‘What the devil, indeed!’ I muttered.
‘What the devil’s the meaning of this?’ exclaimed the host.
‘What was that?’ he asked.
‘What was that?’ inquired Alice.
‘What!’ ejaculated Mr. Pickwick, laying his hand upon his note-book.
‘What!’ he said, with a sudden start.
‘What, don’t you know me?’ said the medical gentleman.
‘What’s Mr. Smithie?’ inquired Mr. Tupman.
‘What’s her name?’ inquired Mary.
‘What’s that in English?’ inquired Sam.
‘What’s that you say?’ - pretending that the kitten was speaking.
‘What’s the matter now?’ said Wardle.
‘What’s the matter with the dogs’ legs?’ whispered Mr. Winkle.
‘What’s the matter?’ he inquired.
‘What’s the matter?’ inquired Sam, looking vacantly about him.
‘What’s the matter?’ inquired the clerk.
‘What’s the matter?’ roared the master of the house.
‘What’s the matter?’ screamed the ladies.
‘What’s the row, Sam?’ inquired one gentleman in black calico sleeves.
‘What’s to be done?’ said he, looking at the bottle.
‘What’s your Christian name, Sir?’ angrily inquired the little judge.
‘What’s your business here?’ he demanded, grimly.
‘When they’re in a good humour,’ interposed the dirty-faced man.
‘Where am I to sleep tonight?’ he inquired.
‘Where am I?’ he exclaimed.
‘Where are we to go to?’ they screamed.
‘Where do you come from?’ inquired the clerk.
‘Where do you come from?’ said the Red Queen.
‘Where do you live?’ said the magistrate.
‘Where is Miss Catherine?’ I cried hurriedly.
‘Where is she — my amiable lady?’
‘Where is the use of the devil in that sentence?’ tittered Linton.
‘Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?’ he asked.
‘Where, ma’am?’ ‘In Ipswich.’
‘Where?’ said Mr. Snodgrass.
‘Where’s Arabella?’ cried a dozen voices..
‘Where’s Heathcliff?’ she said, interrupting me.
‘Where’s Miss Rachael?’ He couldn’t say.
‘Where’s Mr. Jingle, then?’ He didn’t know.
‘Where’s Rachael?’ said Mr. Wardle.
‘Where’s an officer?’ said Mr. Snodgrass.
‘Which door?’ said the Frog.
‘Which way?’ said the boy, in a slow and sleepy voice.
‘Who are at it again?’ she ventured to ask.
‘Who are you?’ said the Caterpillar.
‘Who are you?’ ‘My name was Isabella Linton,’ I replied.
‘Who can it be?’ I thought.
‘Who dares apprehend me?’ said Mr. Tupman.
‘Who ever said it was?’ said the Red Queen.
‘Who has taught you those fine words, my bairn?’ I inquired.
‘Who is he, you scoundrel,’ interposed Wardle.
‘Who is his master?’ continued the tiresome girl, appealing to me.
‘Who is it?’ cried Sam again.
‘Who is she?’ inquired Mr. Tupman.
‘Who is that?’ I whispered.
‘Who is that?’ he asked, hearing some one approaching.
‘Who?’ Short girl — black eyes — niece Emily.
‘Whose then — your master’s?’ she asked.
‘Who’s gone?’ said Mr. Wardle fiercely.
‘Who’s making personal remarks now?’ the Hatter asked triumphantly.
‘Who’s there?’ said Mr. Pickwick, starting up in bed.
‘Who’s your master?’ ‘Devil daddy,’ was his answer.
‘Why all round her head, of course,’ the Rose replied.
‘Why did you not say so to Catherine?’
‘Why don’t you look at it, then?’ inquired Mr. Weller..
‘Why have you that silk frock on, then?’ he said.
‘Why not?’ asked Bob, in reply.
‘Why not?’ said the March Hare.
‘Why not?’ said the chairman.
‘Why shouldn’t he?’ A murmur of assent ran through the company.
‘Why the Lion and the Unicorn, of course,’ said the King.
‘Why, I don’t exactly know about that,’ he replied.
‘Why, I’ve done all the screaming already,’ said the Queen.
‘Why, because there’s nobody with me!’ cried Humpty Dumpty.
‘Why, of course I did,’ replied Mr. Benjamin Allen.
‘Why, she,’ it said.
‘Why, what are your shoes done with?’ it said.
‘Why, what is the matter?’ cried I.
‘Why, yes,’ said the attorney, with a slight cough.
‘Why?’ she asked, aloud.
‘Why?’ she asked, gazing nervously round.
‘Why?” inquired the young lady.
‘Will you allow me to detain you one moment?’ said he.
‘Will you have some breakfast?’ I said.
‘Will you step forward?’ said the officer.
‘Winkle — Winkle!’ he shouted, calling into the inner room.
‘Won’t anybody enliven us?’ said the chairman, despondingly.
‘Won’t it do in the morning?’ said the woman.
‘Won’t it go?’ inquired Mr. Pickwick.
‘Would it be of any use, now,’ thought Alice, ‘to speak to this mouse?
‘Would you like to see a little of it?’ said the Mock Turtle.
‘Wretched woman, look here,’ exclaimed the husband.
‘Yes!’ I reflected to myself, ‘we shall have a fit of illness'.
‘Yes!’ shouted Alice.
‘Yes, I think it is rather good,’ observed Sam, highly flattered.
‘Yes, I think it is,’ resumed Mr. Magnus.
‘Yes, Mr. Weller,’ replied Emma; ‘we always have on Christmas Eve'.
‘Yes, Sir,’ said the gardener.
‘Yes, but then I came and rescued her!’ the White Knight replied.
‘Yes, close it,’ he replied, in his familiar voice.
‘Yes, he is, Sir,’ replied the landlady.
‘Yes, he is,’ was the reply, ‘but he’s very busy'.
‘Yes, if you like,’ said Alice.
‘Yes, indeed!’ replied the boy, with unwonted vivacity.
‘Yes, indeed,’ responded her reprover.
‘Yes, my bed, Sir,’ replied Sam, ‘I’m a prisoner.
‘Yes, my dear,’ he replied, filling a fresh pipe.
‘Yes, now and then,’ I answered.
‘Yes, please do!’ pleaded Alice.
‘Yes, pretty well—some poetry,’ Alice said doubtfully.
‘Yes, this is it,’ said Sam.
‘Yes,’ replied his father, ‘I’ve been here before, in my time'.
‘Yes,’ said Alice, ‘we learned French and music.’
‘Yes,’ said the girl, ‘first floor'.
‘You alarm me!’ said the King.
‘You are a young man,’ said Pott.
‘You are drunk,’ returned the magistrate.
‘You are fairly in for it,’ said the jolly host.
‘You are mad,’ he said.
‘You are not dreaming of it, are you?’ She smiled.
‘You are not really going?’ said he, taking the man aside.
‘You are right, sir,’ replied Mr. Pickwick, ‘they are not'.
‘You are sure nobody spoke?’ ‘Quite sure,’ replied his cousin.
‘You are,’ said the King.
‘You astonish me, Sir,’ said Mr. Leo Hunter.
‘You can,’ replied Mr. Snodgrass.
‘You did!’ said the Hatter.
‘You did, Sir,’ replied the judge, with a severe frown.
‘You did,’ said the Mock Turtle.
‘You don’t know what you’re talking about!’ cried Humpty Dumpty.
‘You don’t seem to mind it,’ observed Bob.
‘You don’t take water, of course?’ said Bob Sawyer.
‘You had better not!’ said Mr. Sawyer, with a threatening aspect.
‘You had better say he won’t,’ replied the chairman.
‘You hear that, Mr. Wicks,’ said Dodson.
‘You in silk stockings!’ exclaimed Mr. Tupman jocosely.
‘You just come away,’ said Mr. Weller.
‘You may go, Sam,’ said Mr. Pickwick.
‘You may retire.’ Sam did retire accordingly.
‘You mean proposing?’ said Mr. Pickwick.
‘You mean to dance?’ said Wardle.
‘You mean us, I suppose’, I answered matter-of-factly.
‘You must hit the trees pretty often, I should think,’ she said.
‘You must not go!’ she exclaimed, energetically.
‘You ought, Sir,’ said the fat gentleman, in an awful voice.
‘You scandalous old hypocrite!’ she replied.
‘You seem unhappy, Mr. Jingle,’ said the lady, in a plaintive voice.
‘You seem very clever at explaining words, Sir,’ said Alice.
‘You shall have it,’ replied Mr. Snodgrass, clasping his friend’s hand.
‘You shall have some of the very best, sir,’ replied the waiter.
‘You shall have tea before you go home,’ he added.
‘You shall make it, sir,’ said the grave man.
‘You shall not meddle with him!’ I continued.
‘You shall smart for this,’ gasped Mr. Pickwick.
‘You should not have spoken to him!’ she expostulated with Master Linton.
‘You take some flour—’ ‘Where do you pick the flower?’ the White Queen asked.
‘You will be sure to come?’ said Mr. Snodgrass.
‘You will convince yourself?’ said Jingle.
‘You will see, I’ve forgiven you’ — I like her forgiving me.
‘Your beasts have trotted off,’ he said.
‘Your health, Sir,’ said Sam.
‘Your worthless friend!’ I answered, warmly: ‘the sneaking rascal yonder'.
‘You’d better hold your tongue, now,’ he answered fiercely.
‘You’d better not talk!’ said Five.
‘You’ll be content with the cushion, Master Heathcliff.
‘You’ll see me what!’ asked Catherine in surprise.
‘You’ll take me in?’ said the benevolent old clergyman.
‘You’re a fool, and may go downstairs,’ said the scientific gentleman.
‘You’re a good fellow’ said the host, grasping his hand.
‘You’re a very poor speaker,’ said the King.
‘You’re holding it upside down!’ Alice interrupted.
‘You’re thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk.
‘You’re very good,’ said Mr. Pickwick.
‘You’ve been wrong!’ cried Tweedledum.
‘You’ve heard of me, I daresay?’ ‘No,’ he replied again.
‘You’ve missed the soup and fish,’ she said.
‘You’ve seen me before, sir.
‘—so long as I get somewhere,’ Alice added as an explanation.
‘“Don’t be frightened,” said Tom.
‘“He’s a tall man,” said Tom.
‘“I leave England tomorrow,” he said, after a moment’s pause.
‘“I’ll astonish you,” said Tom, putting his hand in his pocket.
‘“Who is that gentleman in the bar, ma’am?” inquired Tom.
‘“Wouldn’t she?” said the old gentleman firmly.
’Tis true indeed that she awoke.
’Twill be as easy as stealing milk from a kitten.

“As if ‘Genevieve’ weren’t good enough,” she said.
“As plain as anything,” said Paul.
“At any rate, it is sober,” she said.
“At your mischief again?” he said venomously.
“At your service,” he said politely.
“Ay?” she queried satirically.
“Bah!” she said, with a toss of her head.
“Beat!” he said, as he pulled his hair straight with his fingers.
“Because you were engrossed with Miriam,” replied she hotly.
“Before the next light!” he cried.

“But you look well,” she said proudly, laughing.
“But you mustn’t miss your dance,” she reproved.
“But you say you don’t like business,” she pursued.
“But you should see it down, Paul,” cried Emma earnestly.
“But you’re not doing anything wrong,” she answered impatiently.
“But, why?” began Milo.
“By God, the murderer!” he cried.
“By Jove, the bread!” he cried.
“Bye, Paul,” said one of the girls.
“Can I help it, woman?” he shouted.
“Can I see Mr. Jordan?” she asked.
“Can I show you the town, madam?” “No, thank you,” she answered.
“Can I speak to you?” he said.
“Can I turn them into gold?” “I’m afraid not,” she laughed.
“Can the dispositions not be changed?” I asked.
“Can this be Mr. Darcy?” thought she.
“Can you deny that you have done it?” she repeated.
“Can you wash dishes right?” asked Gill distrustfully.
“Can’t you make a bit less row?” said Mr. Pappleworth.
“Can’t you trust us, mother?” he repeated, rather offended.
“Certainly it has,” said Jip.
“Certainly not,” cried Annie.
“Chock-chock!” went the gate under his thrust.
“Clamber up the ladder,” he whispered.
“Clear, isn’t it?” he said pleasantly.
“Clouds are on fire,” he said.
“Come along,” he said, penitent.
“Come and look at the sweet-peas,” he said to the girl.
“Come and sit you here!” he cried.
“Come back,” he heard.
“Come here, child,” cried her father as she appeared.
“Come in here a moment,” I said.
“Come now,” he called, opening his arms.
“Come on then, Paul,” said Mr. Pappleworth.
“Come on!” cried his guide, with terror in his voice.
“Come on!” said his guide.
“Come on, then, and have first go,” he said to the girl.
“Come on, then,” he replied, jumping up.
“Come on, then,” he said to her.
“Come on,” she coaxed.
“Come, my boy,” said his mother.
“Consider,” he said.
“Cordelia, this is terrible,” she said, trying to speak calmly.
“Count it, boy,” he asked humbly.
“Damn it!” he said.
“Daren’t I?” she asked.
“Dark and damnable,” said the old man suddenly.
“Dear old Africa!” sighed Polynesia.
“Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?” he asked.
“Did you have them mended?” she asked.
“Did you like her?” he asked grudgingly at last.
“Did you read any?” he asked.
“Did you tell him what has happened?” he asked.
“Did you win it?" said Emma
“Did you?” she answered, dully.
“Didn’t you buy the furniture for Walter?” she asked.
“Died years ago.” “What?” said Ollie, sharply.
“Do as I do,” whispered his guide.
“Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?” said she.
“Do you know a new song to teach me?” said Edgar.
“Do you know where Arthur is?” asked Paul at breakfast.
“Do you like her?” “Yes,” came the slow answer.
“Do you like singing?” Miriam asked her.
“Do you like the chrysanthemums?” he asked.
“Do you mean the master of The Saucy Sally?” asked the porpoises.
“Do you mean —?” he began.
“Do you say such nasty things about me?” he laughed.
“Do you still think she is disagreeable?” she asked.
“Do you swim?” said Paul.
“Do you wonder?” he cried.
“Do!” replied the client, with sudden vehemence.
“Do,” said the guard.
“Doctor Spencer was here while you were away,” Carol said.
“Doctor!” he cried.
“Doctor!” she cried.
“Does the new Surveyor know you?” I asked.
“Doesn’t she, William?” Lily laughed.
“Don’t ask me anything about the future,” he said miserably.
“Don’t be afraid,” said a voice.
“Don’t be bitter,” he pleaded.
“Don’t do that, my boy,” said the father.
“Don’t forget that bread,” she said, her voice bright with glee.
“Don’t get flustered, uncle,” he said.
“Don’t let mater know,” he said.
“Don’t they teach you to count at school?” he asked.
“Don’t what, I should like to know?” she exclaimed.
“Don’t you dare!” she cried.
“Don’t you do it, Anne,” entreated Elodie.
“Don’t you do it, Annie,” entreated Diana.
“Don’t you hear the canaries singing?” The Doctor stopped and listened.
“Don’t you like being at home?” Paul asked her, surprised.
“Don’t you see it’s a clue,” I shouted.
“Don’t you think he does it nicely, Miriam?” she asked.
“Don’t you think it’s a great day?” he asked.
“Don’t you think so?” he persisted.
“Don’t you think you’ve treated her rather badly?” she asked.
“Don’t you trouble about these things,” he said.
“Don’t you?” he cried.
“Don’t!” repeated the child, a frown on his clear brow.
“Down the middle path,” she murmured, quivering.
“Down with him!” The lady gave a loud scream.
“Eh, I dunno; that’s what they say,” replied his father.
“Eh, dear, how are you feeling?” she cried in concern.
“Eh?” said my uncle, not at all appearing to comprehend their meaning.
“Eight guineas!” said he.
“Eighty pounds, if you’re so keen on knowing,” she replied.
“Even as we turned away,” he said.
“Even if we differ — ” Raphael glanced; at him sharply.
“Ever so funny, mother,” he replied.
“Everyone knows that, I should think,” said the old man.
“Everything went off very well,” said Eloise practically.
“Fanny’s is better, to my fancy,” said Emma.
“Father — devil!” murmured the convict between his set teeth.
“Father!” said Paul, so that the word rang.
“Feel queer?” he asked.
“Fetched the letters?” Mr. Pappleworth gave a chew to his gum.
“First turn to the right up by the long fir-wood,” he enjoined.
“Five or six?” he asked faintly.
“For that matter, men are dying in London,” he said.
“Fred Pilkington!” he called, quite indifferent.
“Frightful, my dear ma’am; but compose yourself,” said Tom.
“From Rhodesia, you remember.” “Good God, the murderer!” he choked.
“From us all,” she answered hastily.
“Get him away,” cried Fletcher.
“Get the rope!” said Polynesia.
“Get up, and be gone out of my sight,” said the mourner.
“Gilbert Blythe?” said Anne.
“Go along with you!” she said.
“Go and get dressed while I wash up,” he said.
“Go away!” she cried.
“Go away,” she said, and weakly she pushed him off.
“Go away,” she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.
“Go now,” she cried.
“Go now.” He hesitated and understood.
“Go on!” he challenged, his mouth lifted to her.
“Go on,” cried Fraser, laying hands on him.
“Go out of the house!” she commanded him in fury.
“Good Gracious!” cried the Doctor.
“Good evening to you,” he said gravely.
“Good evening, Rachel,” Freya said briskly.
“Good gracious!” exclaimed she, in spite of herself.
“Good gracious, at this time!” exclaimed his wife, as he entered.
“Good night,” she said, a little awkwardly, but not unkindly.
“Good,” said Sir Harry.
“Good-evening,” she replied cordially.
“Good-morning, Sir,” said the widow.
“Good-morning, mother,” he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.
“Good-morning,” he said, kindly and impressively.
“Good-morning,” she replied cheerfully and tenderly.
“Good-night, mother.” “Good-night!” she said.
“Good-night, she,” she said.
“Goodness, man!” she said.
“Goodness, man, don’t be such a kid!” said she.
“Grand!” And he exhorted the children to try.
“Grand!” he said, smacking his lips.
“Guess there’s some mistake,” he said.
“H'm!” she said, pleased.
“Ha!” she laughed in fear.
“Ha, ha!” cried the King.
“Half a minute,” he cried.
“Half a minute,” he said.
“Half-past eight!” he said.
“Hallo!” said my uncle, falling back a step or two.
“Happy New Year,” he called.
“Hark to that gale howling in the East!” they said.
“Hark!” cried the young lady, starting.
“Hark!” said the old man.
“Has my dad been?” he asked.
“Has my dad come?” he asked.
“Has the wind made you tired?” she asked.
“Hasn’t Clara come?” he asked.
“Hateful stiles!” she cried.
“Have they gone?” I asked.
“Have they, mother?” she cried.
“Have you come down alone?” asked Paul.
“Have you contacted my cousin?” he asked.
“Have you enough money, dear?” asked she.
“Have you heard?” he said.
“Have you never seen him since that time?” asked Gill.
“Have you nothing else to do but talk?” said Mr. Pappleworth.
“Have you really been all this time getting ready?” he asked.
“Have you told your mother about Clara?” she asked.
“Haven’t you done that yet?” he would cry.
“Haven’t you got enough?” she asked.
“He has told me a good deal about you,” she said.
“He is a bad writer,” put in she apologetically.
“He is a fool,” said Paul.
“He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,” said her uncle.
“He is safe,” he cried.
“He may go without pudding this day,” said Mrs. Bower.
“He might not have been so bad,” said the doctor.
“He must be an oddity, I think,” said she.
“He says he’s run away,” replied the mother.
“He says it’ll be here on Saturday,” he said.
“He should, shouldn’t he!” cried Beatrice.
“He will never wake,” he said at last.
“He wouldn’t say anything — good, bad or indifferent,” replied the doctor.
“Hello!” he called, sitting on the stairs.
“Hello!” he said rather tenderly to his son.
“Hello!” he said, seeing Paul bareheaded.
“Hello!” she said, soft and musical.
“Hello,” she answered shyly, avoiding eye contact.
“Her presumption” was to be excused.
“Here I am doing nothing,” he said.
“Here are your clothes!” he said.
“Here goes!” he said.
“Here he is!” said Mr. Winterbottom.
“Here is your book, Lily,” said she.
“Here it is!” said she.
“Here you are!” said Pappleworth.
“Here!” piped Paul, small and inadequate.
“Here!” she cried to a man.
“Here’s the most I can make of it,” I said.
“He’ll be up in a few minutes,” he said.
“He’ll look good in uniform,” said Paul irritatingly.
“He’s a nice boy!” cried the woman, again embracing the horse.
“He’s fainted,” gasped Diane.
“He’s quite gentle,” said Miss Limb.
“High spirit,” said I.
“His father was an excellent man,” said Mrs. Gardiner.
“Hm!” said she curiously, when he finished.
“Hold hard, Bill,” he says.
“Holliday,” came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.
“How I do but get criticised,” said Fanny.
“How Nellie will chuckle,” said the plump man.
“How are things going on?” Lucas waved affairs aside.
“How are you, old boy?” said Tom.
“How cheap!” he cried.
“How dare you!” And then — thwack!
“How do you do, Imogen?” she said cordially.
“How do you feel, Catherine?” he repeated.
“How do you know?” she replied.
“How do you put needles in?” he asked.
“How high you are!” she said.
“How is he?” she asked.
“How long has he been like this?” the mother asked the landlady.
“How long?” he asked in a level voice.
“How many years?” he asked.
“How much do you think you’ve given me?” asked Mr. Winterbottom.
“How nicely we are all crammed in,” cried Lydia.
“How old were you when you married?” he asked quietly.
“How pretty!” she exclaimed.
“How should I?” he said.
“How warm!” she said.
“How was I to know?” he exclaimed.
“Hullo, Jopley,” I sang out.
“H’m!” He made a curious, interested sound.
“H’m!” She made a small doubtful sound.
“H’m!” she said, glancing at them, then away again.
“I ain’t doing nothing,” said the child.
“I am a savage.” He paced and stopped.
“I am afraid he must put off his journey,” I said.
“I am afraid you will be hungry,” said she.
“I am her guardian, Tom,” said the old gentleman.
“I am in your hands,” he said.
“I am not bringing them to London,” he said slowly.
“I am not bullying you, sir,” said Ramsey.
“I am quite aware of that,” she replied.
“I am still hardly more than a girl,” she said.
“I am thinking of what you have been telling me,” said she.
“I am!” she gasped.
“I apologise to the shade of Scudder,” he said.
“I beg your pardon,” I replied.
“I believe he loves you,” he said.
“I call it disgraceful,” he said, raising his voice.
“I came to dig a grave, Sir,” stammered Gabriel.
“I can carry it,” he answered, rather injured.
“I can do it myself,” she replied.
“I can give you a kiss today,” she said apologetically.
“I cannot commit murder,” I replied.
“I cannot tell them yet,” he answered.
“I can’t be bothered!” she exclaimed crossly.
“I can’t, guv’nor,” I said in a real beggar’s whine.
“I could kill you, I could!” she said.
“I could never be so soft.” Her voice was strong and contralto.
“I couldn’t give her up now,” he said.
“I dare do more than you,” she cried.
“I declare, it is the pirates’ rum-room!” said Jip in a whisper.
“I did not know you read French,” he said, very polite.
“I did that for you,” he said.
“I did,” said I.
“I didn’t ask you to eat them,” he said quietly.
“I didn’t know a bird was watching,” he called.
“I do indeed,” replied Elizabeth, colouring.
“I do like to talk to her,” he answered irritably.
“I do not know when I have been more shocked,” said she.
“I do not regret that.” She looked at him quickly.
“I do not understand,” he cried.
“I do not,” replied his mother.
“I do,” she said.
“I don’t believe I should ever be sea-sick.” Away he went.
“I don’t know what to make of it,” he said at last.
“I don’t know what you mean,” I said roughly.
“I don’t know what you want,” she said, continuing her task.
“I don’t know what’s in your blue handkerchief,” she said.
“I don’t know, my boy,” she replied piteously.
“I don’t know,” she faltered.
“I don’t know,” she murmured.
“I don’t know,” she said.
“I don’t know,” sobbed the child.
“I don’t like the look of that sail,” said Dab-Dab.
“I don’t mind.” There was a moment’s pause.
“I don’t think so,” she replied.
“I don’t trust myself,” she said.
“I don’t understand,” he said.
“I don’t understand,” said Maxwell.
“I don’t want Annie to feel handicapped,” he said, struggling.
“I don’t want it, mother,” he pleaded.
“I don’t want it.” “Oh, very well,” said his mother.
“I don’t want to smell their rubbish,” she said, sniffing.
“I don’t wish to,” she said, very low.
“I don’t!” she repeated more positively than ever.
“I doubt if he will wake,” he said at last.
“I feel badly, mother.” She undressed him and put him to bed.
“I feel sorry about Bumpo,” said the Doctor.
“I felt sure there was twopence left,” said the Doctor.
“I forbid it,” said Roan.
“I hate you!” She laughed with glee.
“I have broken off with her,” he said.
“I have never seen anything more beautiful than this,” he said.
“I have not your faith,” he said.
“I have spoken to him,” he said.
“I have wanted to see you,” he said.
“I hope you don’t mind my coming,” she faltered.
“I knew,” she said, and stopped.
“I knew,” she whispered.
“I know all about that, Tom,” said the old gentleman.
“I know all about that.” ‘“About what?” said Tom.
“I leave my things lying about,” he said.
“I like it very much,” replied Clara.
“I like the darkness,” he said.
“I like this,” she announced at length.
“I love cornflowers on things,” said Paul.
“I may call in as I go to chapel,” she said.
“I meant to say, Yes.” I had forgotten all about my alias.
“I must fetch a doctor at once,” he said.
“I must learn to fly,” he cried.
“I must see Sir Walter,” I panted.
“I must shave,” he said looking at himself in the glass.
“I must sleep,” he said.
“I never expected it so soon,” he cried.
“I never had the least inclination to,” she replied.
“I never thought,” he said.
“I only wanted to try,” she said in a low voice.
“I remember you quite well,” said Pat.
“I said I’d be early.” He was very awkward.
“I see what you are feeling,” replied Charlotte.
“I see your design, Bingley,” said his friend.
“I see,” he remarked inadequately.
“I shall break off with Miriam, mother,” he answered calmly.
“I shall never forgive Gilbert Naylor,” said Anne firmly.
“I shall not meddle in the matter,” I retorted again.
“I shall please myself,” he retorted.
“I shan’t come and meet you,” he said.
“I should have the trouble of dragging you down again,” she said.
“I should have watched the living, not the dead,” she told herself.
“I should like some radishes,” she answered.
“I shouldn’t mind swimming here,” he said.
“I smell no snuff as yet,” he said.
“I suppose it is open to anybody?” she asked him.
“I suppose it’s my heart,” she replied.
“I suppose they are.” He mused.
“I suppose you have a nightgown?” she questioned.
“I think Clara has such beautiful arms,” he said.
“I think she’s rather tired, mother,” said William.
“I think you are despicable!” she said.
“I think you’ll like it,” she said.
“I thought it couldn’t be your voice,” she said.
“I thought the house we live in — ” she began.
“I thought you weren’t coming,” he said.
“I told you!” he said, running to the dresser for his cap.
“I very much doubt it,” said his mother coldly.
“I want a word with you.” And I led him into the dining-room.
“I want it in five minutes,” he said.
“I want to have these things explained,” said Ralph.
“I want to learn more about this machine,” repeated Price.
“I want to see more of that,” cried Miles, resisting.
“I want to write books,” he said.
“I was awfully near giving up in despair,” explained Angel.
“I was frightened.” They drove on and on.
“I was sure you weren’t coming,” he laughed shakily.
“I was thinking about Ayesha,” she explained.
“I wasn't up very early,” I said.
“I went to bed before you did,” he said.
“I went to work, mother,” he said plaintively.
“I will apply when the advertisement is out,” she said.
“I will call him Paul,” she said suddenly; she knew not why.
“I will go first,” said the guide.
“I will rule - ” He paused.
“I will tell you a tale,” he said.
“I will, my lass,” he answered, turning away.
“I will,” said my uncle.
“I wish the nuisance would come,” she said wearily to herself.
“I wonder!” she answered.
“I wondered how much that little dish was,” she said.
“I wouldn’t feel comfortable without it,” she thought.
“I wouldn’t get the apple-blossom,” said Edgar, the eldest brother.
“I!” exclaimed Miriam in amazement.
“I'll see you get your papers in good time,” he said.
“If I’m not sick!” she cried suddenly.
“If it is good,” she said.
“If one could but go to Brighton!” observed Mrs. Bennet.
“If she knew!” said Clara quietly to him.
“If you would stop crying I could,” said Bay imploringly.
“In a moment,” said Howard.
“Indeed I have, sir,” was her answer.
“Indeed we have,” said Esther.
“Insolent girl!” said Elizabeth to herself.
“Insufferable woman!” was her immediate exclamation.
“Is his Lordship at home?” I asked.
“Is it a lot?” he asked.
“Is it as late as that, mother?” he said.
“Is it bad?” asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.
“Is it better to stay friends with someone who's wronged you?”
“Is it really a tumour?” he asked.
“Is motherhood gone?” he said.
“Is she gone?” he eagerly inquired.
“Is that place an inn?” I asked.
“Is that two o’clock striking?” Mrs. Dawes said in surprise.
“Is the bread done?” she asked, going to the oven.
“Is this the way to the farm?” she asked.
“Isn’t he shameless, Miriam?” “Quite,” said Miriam.
“Isn’t he!” Again she kissed him.
“Isn’t it a strange warmth!” she murmured, to get near him.
“Isn’t it beautiful?” she pleaded.
“Isn’t it dreadful?” she asked.
“Isn’t it just like a palace?” whispered Erin.
“Isn’t it wonderful?” She was curious about him.
“Isn’t my father going to get up?” asked William.
“It doesn’t go far,” she answered.
“It doesn’t hurt a bit,” said Paul.
“It has been nice, hasn’t it?” he asked.
“It has come,” he said.
“It is May!” he heard her say.
“It is a ledge,” he whispered.
“It is all over,” he cried.
“It is all over,” she informed Meg.
“It is hateful, their mean gloating,” she said intensely.
“It is impossible,” protested the man in yellow.
“It is late — but we can read just a little,” she pleaded.
“It is only an old umbrella, isn’t it?” she asked.
“It is preposterous,” he cried.
“It is slippery,” he said.
“It is so different every second” I thought. It keeps changing.
“It is so long ago,” she said.
“It is that,” replied the man.
“It is —,” she cried, speechless, incredulous, triumphant.
“It is,” said the client.
“It looks like it,” she replied.
“It looks rather come down,” said Paul.
“It must have seemed strange to you,” she said abruptly.
“It only makes you laugh,” he said.
“It ought not to do that,” said his mother.
“It was Aunt Josephine,” said Diana, gasping with laughter.
“It was a rash one,” said she.
“It was all that stupid pig’s fault,” said Polynesia.
“It was her own fault,” he said to himself.
“It was not the echoes,” said the goblin.
“It was not,” said a deep voice.
“It was splendid,” Anne related to Sharon later on.
“It will be clearer later,” said Foster.
“It won’t hurt you,” said Paul.
“It would be possible,” said Luke thoughtfully.
“It would pass the time,” said Gardner.
“It wouldn’t matter but for the boys,” she said to him.
“It’ll come,” he smiled.
“It’ll help, mother?” he asked wistfully.
“It’s a bit nippy,” he replied.
“It’s a chance,” he said.
“It’s a heart-breaking job,” said Barker.
“It’s a mess!” he said.
“It’s a pity he can’t talk,” she said.
“It’s a silly business, this kissing,” he said.
“It’s a strange state,” said Gordon.
“It’s a swindle!” he said.
“It’s a treat of a swing,” he said.
“It’s a wild road, mother,” said Paul.
“It’s about Clara,” sobbed Anne luxuriously.
“It’s about Di,” sobbed Amaya luxuriously.
“It’s an hour an’ a half late,” said Arthur pathetically.
“It’s bad enough,” she replied.
“It’s done,” he said, giving it to her.
“It’s easy speaking,” he moaned.
“It’s extremely interesting,” Anne told Deborah.
“It’s from your son, Arthur,” he said.
“It’s got to be more retired than that,” I said.
“It’s music,” he said.
“It’s no more than I thought,” she answered.
“It’s not a bobby-dazzler at all!” she replied.
“It’s not a cert, you know,” he remarked.
“It’s not fair to me,” she murmured.
“It’s not religious to be religious,” he said.
“It’s not that,” he answered.
“It’s nothing, my boy,” she murmured.
“It’s only once in the bluest of blue moons,” he said.
“It’s perfectly awful stuff, Juno,” she groaned.
“It’s red, ain’t it?” he said.
“It’s so ripping!” he said, setting her in motion.
“It’s splendid!” he said, smelling its perfume.
“It’s the cigarettes,” replied Beatrice demurely.
“It’s the girl our William is going with,” replied she.
“It’s the moon,” he answered, frowning.
“It’s time you were dressed,” she said curtly.
“It’s true: he has got the first prize,” said she.
“It’s up the entry,” said Paul.
“It’s very quiet.” She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.
“I’d rather have had something softer,” she said.
“I’ll be haunting the post office Wednesday,” vowed Diana.
“I’ll call you Penelope,” he said.
“I’ll do nothing of the sort,” said my uncle.
“I’ll fetch him,” answered the young man.
“I’ll go,” said Annie.
“I’ll have it,” she said.
“I’ll imagine that I like them,” said Aaliyah soberly.
“I’ll keep him out five minutes,” he exclaimed.
“I’ll light her the candle, mother,” he said.
“I’ll teach you, if you like.” Her eyes dilated.
“I’m a colonial and travel light.” “A colonial,” he cried.
“I’m afraid you’re cold, Mr. Wesson,” said she.
“I’m badly, mother!” he replied.
“I’m dreadful sorry,” said Mrs. Wade.
“I’m going back to school,” she announced.
“I’m going to bed.” To bed went Connor.
“I’m going to look,” he said..
“I’m going to teach Miriam algebra,” he said.
“I’m not going any more,” he declared.
“I’m not sad; why should I be,” he answered.
“I’m not,” said Annie.
“I’m so damned spiritual with you always!” he cried.
“I’m so glad you came up,” Beatrix said sincerely.
“I’m sorry I was late,” he said shyly.
“I’m sure I don’t want to,” she said.
“I’m sure she was trying hard,” said the mother.
“I’m sure you’re tired and cold,” she said.
“I’m sure!” she exclaimed, sniffing with mock scepticism.
“I’m thankful it wasn’t that brute,” said she.
“I’m very sorry,” he said humbly.
“I’m well off,” she said, smiling.
“I’ve brought you the Portland Place murderer,” was Sir Walter’s introduction.
“I’ve given him his dinner,” replied Mrs. Bower.
“I’ve got thirty-three quid,” he said.
“I’ve had a long turn,” he said.
“I’ve heard a bit about you from Clara,” continued the mother.
“I’ve never known Jerry mean in my life,” protested he.
“I’ve torn my sleeve,” he answered.
“I’ve won a prize in a competition, dad,” he said.
“John Bower!” he repeated.
“Jump,” said the voice.
“Just do what I tell you to and follow me!” the mean man said.
“Just like Canada.” “Isn’t it beautiful!” said she, looking round.
“Kiss me,” she whispered.
“Kiss?” he invited her.
“Let him lie,” the mother replied.
“Let me get you a lunch anyhow,” implored Amelia.
“Let me help to wash up,” she said.
“Let me take the rug,” said Miriam over-gently.
“Let us get on,” he said.
“Let us go,” he said.
“Let us have the facts,” said Rhys.
“Let us sit here a minute,” said Miriam.
“Let us stay here awhile,” he said.
“Let’s look at it,” he said, hiccoughing again.
“Let’s make a sacrifice of Arabella,” he said.
“Let’s see,” said Paul.
“Let’s undress here,” said Elise.
“Light, old boy?” said Beatrice, tilting her cigarette at him.
“Like treading among the stars,” he said, with a quaky laugh.
“Listen, Ben Ali,” said John Dolittle, leaning over the side.
“Listen, Sir Harry,” I said.
“Lonely,” said I.
“Look at my hair, Pamela,” she whispered.
“Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!” he sneered.
“Look at the time,” said the old man.
“Look how they’ve come out of the wood!” he said.
“Look!” whispered Nicholas, crouched close, and became very still.
“Look, dad!” he said.
“Lord save us!” cried the duck.
“Lovely!” “I wonder who’ll buy it!” he said.
“Make him stop drinking,” he prayed every night.

“My blame, sir,” I answered him.
“My boy!” she cried.
“My boy!” she said, in a voice trembling with passionate love.

“Never mind,” she replied.
“Never mind,” she said.
“Never,” said my uncle.
“Nine o’clock!” he said.
“No better,” said the landlady.
“No hanky-panky,” said the man affectionately to the beast.
“No higher!” “But you’re not a bit high,” he remonstrated.
“No!” said Oscar starting.
“No, I do not, fellow,” rejoined my uncle.
“No, I don’t think so,” she said firmly.
“No, I think not,” he answered.
“No, I won’t dance,” she said softly.
“No, I won’t go first,” she answered.
“No, I’ve not been well,” he said.
“No, my duck,” the hunchback woman answered, lavishly tender.
“No, no,” cried G., still gripping his arm.
“No, no,” returned the widow hastily.
“No,” I said.
“No,” he answered without reflecting.
“No,” said Jip.
“No,” said the Frenchman.
“No,” she answered truthfully.
“No,” she cried, starting up, scarce able to breathe.
“No,” she laughed, trembling.
“No,” she said slowly.
“No,” she said, “it was the girls.” “What about ’em?” Paul asked.
“No; I don’t want to see you,” she replied.
“No; you go on,” she said.
“Nonsense!” said the official from the Admiralty.
“Not a bit of it,” said he.
“Not as ill as I wish,” he replied.
“Not at all,” said he.
“Not sinners, are we?” he said, with an uneasy little frown.

“Pardon,” he said, “I’m a bit rattled tonight”.
“Paul!” she said, uninterestedly.
“Paul’s come!” she exclaimed.
“Perhaps he thought they would annoy you,” said Samuel.
“Perhaps he thought they would annoy you,” she said.
“Perhaps so,” she said.
“Perhaps,” he whispered doubtfully.
“Perhaps,” she answered, smiling.

“Read that,” he said.
“Ruby Dennis thinks of nothing but beaus,” said Anne disdainfully.
“Run, Heathcliff, run!” she whispered.
“Sad!” she exclaimed, looking up at him with startled, wonderful brown eyes.
“Say you’re not drunk!” she flashed.
“Say you’re not drunk,” he repeated.
“Saying such a thing!” “I do,” repeated he.
“Scotland Yard,” I said.
“See here,” I whispered.
“See!” cried Dab-Dab.

“Sorry I left these things littering about,” he said.
“Stand off!” cried the old man, with a dreadful oath.
“Stand off!” shrieked the old man.

“Would you believe it!” exclaimed she.
“Would you care to be back at Jordan’s?” he asked Clara.

“Yes, she did,” admitted Cynthia.
“Yes, she shall have them all,” she replied, beaming with joy.
“Yes, she was,” replied Annie.
“Yes, she’s a nice girl,” she continued.
“Yes, there are plenty,” said Polynesia.
“Yes, you do,” said Dab-Dab, the duck.
“Yes,” replied Miriam in her musical tone.
“Yes,” replied Miriam, as she walked at his side.
“Yes,” said Mohammed thoughtfully.
“Yes,” said Otis, guessing that her word meant "flying machine".
“Yes,” said the Doctor.
“Yes,” she answered doubtfully.
“Yes,” she replied, going to unpack her bag.
“Yes,” she said hesitatingly.
“Yes.” His voice already came out of the darkness.
“Yes; prime, isn’t it?” replied Mr. Pappleworth indifferently.
“Yes; there are bad times, and good,” said she.
“Yes; they make me so fine, I hardly know myself,” she answered.
“Yet you always make me like it,” he said.
“Yet —.” He thought for an instant.
“You always pretend to be such a hard-hearted hussy,” he laughed.
“You are Maya?” said Graham.
“You are a child of four,” she repeated in her anger.
“You are a little cat, Beat,” he said at length, half apologetically.
“You are doing too much,” said his mother to him.
“You are going anywhere?” he asked.
“You are late!” she said, looking at him.
“You are late,” he said.
“You are ridiculous,” said his sister, and walked out of the room.
“You are so clever, my friend,” she said coolly.
“You are so fine!” she said.
“You are too hasty, sir,” she cried.
“You are with us?” “Where have you been?” said Roman.
“You aren’t glad!” he reproached her; but he trembled violently.
“You aren’t one of the pirates, are you?” he asked.
“You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her.
“You can have some more bacon,” continued Mrs. Radford.
“You can see what it’s done,” she answered.
“You can take up your life where you left off,” I was told.
“You could not have visited me!” she cried, looking aghast.
“You didn’t think we’d forgot you?” she asked, reproachful.
“You didn’t think, mother — ” he began tentatively.
“You do like it?” he asked.
“You don’t give me time to learn it,” she said.
“You don’t have much in your garden,” he said.
“You don’t know,” said the old man.
“You don’t mind?” Still she did not answer.
“You don’t really like her, do you?” he asked the girl.
“You don’t want me!” she cried.
“You forget you have a master here,” says the tyrant.
“You forget,” she said, drawing a deep breath.
“You had better go.” “Go?” said the red-bearded man.
“You had better stand aside,” said I to the poor creature.
“You have chosen a fine day,” he said.
“You have not betrayed us?” she cried.
“You have stayed to dinner!” he exclaimed.
“You know you like them,” she said.
“You look as if you could do with it,” she said.
“You love me, don’t you?” she murmured.
“You made a vow,” said she.
“You make me so spiritual!” he lamented.
“You may dismiss the police from your mind,” he said.
“You may not travel through my lands,” said the King.
“You mean Miss Limb?” asked Miriam.
“You mean if it is high-class and trained?” he said.
“You mean, hateful boy!” she exclaimed passionately.
“You might fetch Mrs. Bower,” said she.
“You must come away at once.” Matthew made no answer.
“You must have been right home with her,” his mother continued.
“You must have clothes at once,” he said.
“You must not stop here,” shouted Howard.
“You mustn’t sell Green Gables,” said Anne resolutely.
“You my new lad?” he said.
“You needn’t come if you don’t want,” she said.
“You never did have a grain of sense!” she screamed.
“You read French, do you?” he cried.
“You really do blossom out sometimes,” he said.
“You said you wanted,” he insisted.
“You seem in a hurry, my friend,” he said slowly.
“You seem to forget.” The aeronaut scrutinised his face.
“You should try!” Again she shook her head.
“You the new lad?” “Yes,” said Paul.
“You wait a minute,” said she to Annie.
“You want some flowers,” he said, going to the nearest florist’s.
“You want to grate it,” said Beatrice.
“You were late,” she said.
“You wheedle the soul out of things,” he said.
“You will come?” “I think so,” she replied, murmuring.
“You will let me help you wash up,” said Clara.
“You will like to go upstairs,” said she.
“You will never leave me,” murmured the young lady.
“You will soon be cooler, if you sit still,” she said.
“You will very speedily have clothes,” said the thickset man.
“You won’t die if they do,” said the mother.
“You won’t scream?” said Tom doubtfully.
“You would need to go disguised,” he said.
“You — are — a prisoner,” panted Nell, exulting.
“Your horse is a fine fellow!” said Clara.
“Your mother hasn’t relented?” she gasped.
“Your paper woke them up,” he said gleefully.
“Your poison!” said a voice in Musa’s ear.
“You’d never notice anything,” said Annie.
“You’ll know me next time, guv’nor,” I said.
“You’ll take care, won’t you?” she pleaded.
“You’re a liar!” he yelled, banging the table with his fist.
“You’re going to get it from me now,” said Dawes.
“You’re never jolly, or even just all right.” “No,” she pondered.
“You’re not going home, are you?” she asked anxiously.
“You’re not sorry she’s married, mother, are you?” he asked.
“You’re only a bird!” “Quite true,” said the parrot.
“You’re the right sort of fellow,” he said.
“You’re too blessed superior for anything,” he said.
“You’re young to be an innkeeper,” I said.
“You’ve a fine taste in boots,” he said.
“You’ve been crying,” remarked Sherry, with aggravating pity.
“You’ve done well this week,” he said.
“You’ve never tried,” she answered.
“‘Monsieur,’” he began; then he looked in great confusion at Mr. Jordan.
“‘Transpires’ — oh yes!” “‘Transpires!’” repeated she mockingly.
