"A dreary name," said the Lord Chancellor.
"A fog, miss," said the young gentleman.
"A man of European reputation," murmured Mr. Badger.
"A very excellent idea," I said, and did so.
"A very excellent idea," said Aunt Dahlia.
"A virtue in which few Englishmen are deficient," observes Mr. Tulkinghorn.
"A woman and a man," he said.
"About five feet seven," he answered.
"Absolutely," I said with approval.
"Ah, my poor friend!" he said, when he saw the young man's distress.
"Ah, yes," he said, carelessly.
"Ah, you will be content, Adele, tonight," she cried.
"All right now," returns the trooper.
"All right," he said.
"All that I know I will tell readily," said Harry.
"All this, my dear," said I.
"Amen," said Aunt Dahlia.
"And Bleak House," said his lordship, "is in Hertfordshire".
"And I can never forget it," said Ada.
"And again," says mademoiselle with more tight and angry nods.
"And again," she repeats, cataleptic with determination.
"And here he is," said the Commissaire.
"And it sounds" he said, "like a small sum."
"And not you alone," he said, with a smile.
"And refused all proposals," said my guardian.
"And was I not wise?" he said, with complacency.
"Any one might forget," he said, with a reassuring smile.
"Anywhere's nowhere," said Miss Jellyby, stopping perversely.
"Anywhere, my dear," I replied.
"At twenty-five minutes past ten," replied the clerk shortly.
"Attila," she said at length.
"Babies come from amazon.com," he deadpanned.
"Bad show this, my dear old flesh and blood," I said.
"Be careful how you chew," I advised..
"Be so kind as to act as my solicitor," said Grandfather.
"Besides, your description is incomplete," he said.
"Besides," he added, breaking fiercely out, "I'll shame them."
"But Geneva is a big city" cried Harry in exasperation.
"But I don't want to live here," cried Dorothy.
"But I must," she said with a laugh.
"But don't let me wander from the subject," she resumed.
"But it is very possible that it does matter," he said gently.
"But it must have been this morning, I think," said I.
"But more persuadable we can, I hope," said I.
"But of course," she at once replied.
"But perhaps — " She stopped.
"But she could cry out," exclaimed Ricardo.
"But she said Adele's hair was black," interposed Mr. Ricardo.
"But that is a fine suggestion," he cried.
"But that is astounding," he said, in an awe-struck voice.
"But we must cross it," said the Scarecrow.
"But we must have a basket to ride in," he said.
"But you had already guessed 'Geneva,'" said Ricardo.
"But you must have made a mistake," said the Commissaire.
"But you never said a word about it to us," he grumbled.
"But you will have a nurse," he said firmly.
"But" he stammered, "the case upon the dressing-room table was empty."
"But, mademoiselle, you are safe," he said, with a smile.
"By all means," he replied, with a smile of extreme courtesy.
"Can't you see the scene?" he asked with a queer smile of excitement.
"Certainly I permit it," said Celia, with indifference.
"Certainly not, Sir Leicester," "I am glad to hear it."
"Certainly, if madame wishes," said Helene submissively.
"Certainly, old bird," I said cordially.
"Charley," said I, "are you so cold?"
"Come in," said Oz.
"Come, Helene, be quick," said Celia.
"Come, my friend," he said, "let us hear exactly how this happened!"
"Come," he says; "I am ready."
"Confide fully in him," she said after a little while.
"Death must have been instantaneous," said the doctor.
"Decent of you to rally round, Bertie," she said.
"Did you hear anything?" he asked in a whisper.
"Did you know that?" he asked in English.
"Does it matter," he asked, with some solicitude.
"Don't be frivolous, my dear old butler," I said.
"Don't mention it, old man," I responded courteously.
"Don't mind this gentleman," he says in his quiet way.
"Don't try me too high," she begged.
"Don't try, my dear," he answered.
"Esther, dear," she said very quietly, "I am not going home again."
"Every one of them, miss," said Charley.
"Everything is in the safe," Helene insisted.
"Fishy," he said.
"For the last time," she pleaded to herself.
"For tonight," he said, "I am your papa!"
"For you, miss, if you please," said she.
"For you," she said with a kiss.
"From gentlemen to apprentices," said my guardian, smiling.
"Geneva time is an hour later than French time," he said shortly.
"Get me some gum or paste, and quickly," he said.
"Gimme," said Aunt Dahlia listlessly.
"Glinda might," he suggested.
"Go on, mademoiselle," he said.
"Go on," exclaimed Dorothy.
"God bless him," I thought, "for his truth to me!"
"Good-bye," replied the princess.
"Hallo, Bertie, you old ass," was her very matey greeting.
"He ain't come in yet," says Judy.
"He has never hurt anybody but himself," says Mr. George, smiling.
"He is changed," he returned, shaking his head.
"He is living concealed at Mr. George's," said I.
"He looks as if he had not slept," he said.
"He should look in the safe," said she.
"He was arrested this evening," he said.
"Helene is expecting us," said she.
"Her manner was strange," said I.
"Her room is, I think, upstairs," he said.
"Here I am," says Bart.
"Here he is," said Hanaud, taking up his hat.
"Here is another space between the trees," called the Lion.
"His parents will be expecting him," Helene added.
"How could he have the news?" exclaimed Ricardo, whose brain was whirling.
"How still and peaceful everything is," said Angela.
"Hullo, eyesore," she said.
"I accept it with many thanks," returned the trooper.
"I admit it most fully and freely," said I.
"I always thought you were such friends," said Angela.
"I am afraid, my friend, that is so," he said gravely.
"I am in town on leave just now," said Richard.
"I am very glad indeed to hear it," says Sir Leicester.
"I am very glad to go there, sir," I answered.
"I am well enough," says Mr. George.
"I am well known to be prudent," says Mr. George, composedly smoking.
"I beg mademoiselle's pardon if I hurt her," said Adele.
"I beg your pardon, sir," he said.
"I can never forget it," said Richard.
"I can't come back, my dear," called Oz from the basket.
"I can't imagine," said I.
"I can't wait," he cried, with a passionate appeal.
"I can't," she returned.
"I can, and I do," I said.
"I cannot understand your calmness," he exclaimed.
"I couldn't do that," she exclaimed.
"I couldn't say," he replied, beginning to sidle round the bench.
"I covet nothing," said he in the same light way.
"I did not," he said, "I do not now".
"I didn't know I was crying, sir," I faltered.
"I do not know," answered Harry.
"I do," said I, "quite confidently."
"I don't know yet," said Bucket in the same tone.
"I don't mean absolutely that," he returned.
"I don't say that," he returned, gravely.
"I don't take kindly to the breed," said Mr. George.
"I feel wise, indeed," he answered, earnestly.
"I go out to work, sir," returns Charley.
"I had not followed my suggestion to its conclusion," he admitted humbly.
"I hardly know what it was like, guv'nor," said Phil, considering.
"I hate publicity," said Ricardo acidly.
"I have a sister in London, a widow," he said.
"I have always liked you as you were," said Dorothy, simply.
"I have come for my brains," remarked the Scarecrow, a little uneasily.
"I have come for my courage," announced the Lion, entering the room.
"I have nothing to say to you," rejoins Mr. Tulkinghorn.
"I have quite recovered my health and my cheerfulness," said I.
"I have taken your good luck away," said the girl remorsefully.
"I have," said the Scarecrow.
"I hope he does," says Tony, "but I doubt it."
"I hope number two's as good" snarls the old man.
"I hope you will pardon me," she said humbly.
"I know quite enough about it," returns Tony.
"I know, monsieur, that Helene is not my friend," she said.
"I left this behind me," he said, putting it into his pocket.
"I may come too?" cried Mr. Ricardo eagerly.
"I mean to try hard," she answers, wiping her eyes.
"I must succeed tonight," she said to herself — "I must!"
"I passed the gate of the villa about half-past nine," he said.
"I quite understand that," said I.
"I really don't, sir," I returned.
"I remember the whole incident vividly," I said.
"I say, Bertie," she said, meditatively chewing fruit salad.
"I see," I said, though I didn't, being still fogged.
"I see," he said, at length.
"I shall be glad to have your company," said Dorothy.
"I shall be guided," replies George, "entirely by it."
"I shall not put him to the proof," said my guardian.
"I shall not want them," said Celia.
"I shall see you tomorrow evening," he said, holding her hand.
"I shall try," he said.
"I should have thought," he said solemnly.
"I should think not," rejoins Mr. Bucket.
"I suppose not," said Dorothy.
"I suppose there will be," she said regretfully.
"I thank you, miss," said he.
"I think I am, miss," she replied.
"I think I do," says Jo.
"I think I know what's on your mind, Tuppy," I said.
"I think it is ready," said I.
"I think she wore them," she said doubtfully.
"I think so," said he, laughing.
"I think that I can," he said, and he produced his card.
"I thought you might have been a trifle peeved," I said.
"I understand," he said, meekly accepting the correction.
"I want you to fly with me to Kansas," said Dorothy.
"I will go down and open the gate," he whispered.
"I will have inquiries made," he said.
"I will tell you," he said, in his most confidential tones.
"I will turn on the light," she said.
"I will wear what you please," she said, with a smile.
"I will, indeed," he replied cheerily.
"I wish I could," she murmured.
"I wish it was," he returned, "with all my heart."
"I wish it were," growls Tony, without changing his position.
"I wrote a letter while we were taking our luncheon," he explained.
"I'm cleaning the upstairs back room, miss," replies Charley.
"I'm very sorry," returned Dorothy; "please forgive us."
"I've got it," I said.
"If it is not being troublesome," said we.
"If only we are in time!" he said, catching his breath.
"If you believe you are a good prophet," said I.
"If you please, sir," said I.
"If you were to go to her;" He shook his head.
"Impossible," she repeated.
"In the meantime," I ventured to observe, "he is getting worse."
"Indeed I do," he said, with a laugh.
"Indeed, I think so, Esther," replied she.
"Is it," Mr. George muses, "blank cartridge or ball?"
"It draws," says Jo, "as heavy as a cart."
"It is a green fabric," he said very wisely.
"It is all done," he said, with a nod of the head.
"It is green chiffon," he said.
"It is infamous," he cried passionately.
"It is kind of you to like a Scarecrow," he replied.
"It is not likely to occur again," said I, smiling.
"It is not surprising," said he.
"It is not true, monsieur," cried Celia earnestly.
"It is terrible," he said.
"It might open a new world to him," said I.
"It seems gloomy," said the Scarecrow.
"It shall wait here," said Ricardo.
"It was a powerful car?" "Sixty horse-power," he said.
"It was a shot," he said.
"It was in the north, sir, as we came down," observed Richard.
"It was madame who wished you to believe," she stammered.
"It was not I who sent it," said Ricardo eagerly.
"It will be necessary to keep that," he said.
"It will do us good to walk, madame," pleaded Adele.
"It will make no difference now," he said.
"It would be kind," said Helene.
"It's a mistake," he said.
"It's all for nothing!" he screamed rather than cried.
"It's all right," I said.
"It's cursed luck," he said.
"It's disgraceful," she said.
"It's the boy, miss," said he.
"It's twenty-four pounds, sixteen, and sevenpence ha'penny," observed the stranger.
"Jeeves," I said, "I had not expected this of you."
"Jeeves," I said, "a word with you."
"Jeeves," I said, "all this is a bit thick."
"Jeeves," I said, "do you know what?"
"Jewels which she keeps in the safe in her bedroom," she added.
"Judy," says the old man, "have you got the pipe?"
"Just run through that wheeze again, Jeeves," I said thoughtfully.
"Just so, just so," the old man nods.
"Just so," observes the stationer with his confirmatory cough.
"Keep your hands so, please, mademoiselle," said Adele; "your fingers loose."
"Let me hear," he said gravely.
"Let me look at your forehead," he says, bending down.
"Let me see," said I, pretending to consider.
"Let me see," said Richard, looking at his watch.
"Let me see," said she.
"Let us go somewhere at any rate," said I.
"Let us go," he said.
"Listen to me," he said solemnly.
"Look here," said Tony, recoiling.
"Lovely evening," I said.
"Lovely," I agreed.
"Mademoiselle has not moved," she said.
"Marrow puddings," he says instantly.
"Military time, sir," he replied.
"Miss Clare," said the Lord Chancellor.
"Miss Summerson really is my ward," he said.
"Miss Summerson," he repeated, and looked at me again.
"Monsieur is pleased to laugh at me," he said.
"Monsieur, I am speaking the truth," said the chauffeur.
"Monsieur," he cried, "something has been taken from this room."
"Monsieur," she said, "you do not go the right way."
"More than ever," he said.
"My dear, I don't know it," said I.
"My friend, I also am remembering those words," he said.
"My place was by your side, Aunt Dahlia," I responded.
"Never mind the patch," exclaimed the happy Woodman.
"No doubt," is Mr. Tulkinghorn's composed reply.
"No idea of money," observed Mr. Bucket.
"No knife made it," he asserted.
"No one can pass," said he.
"No", said Celia, with a contemptuous laugh.
"No, my dear," said I.
"No, my friend, she could not cry out," he replied very seriously.
"No, my friend," he answered.
"No, no, my love," said he.
"No," said I, as she seemed to wait for me.
"No," said Ricardo, with a smile.
"Nonsense, my friend," he said, clapping the disconsolate man upon the shoulder.
"Nor could I — at the time," said he.
"Not a bit of it," said the strange man.
"Not in the least," said he.
"Not to you," said Gussie.
"Not too quickly," he whispered.
"Nothing could have kept me away," I replied, touched.
"Nothing particular," returns the trooper.
"Nothing," I said.
"Now, mistress," said the lawyer, tapping the key hastily upon the chimney-piece.
"Now," she adds, "show me the spot again!"
"O Lord," said the young man.
"Of course not," said madame briskly.
"Of course you should, you silly ass," said Gussie genially.
"Of course, madame," she said, with a certain submissiveness which surprised Ricardo.
"Oh, I don't go so far as that," he said reluctantly.
"Oh, Mrs. Woodcourt," said I, "that is so difficult!"
"Oh, aye," replied Richard, "I'm all right."
"Oh, dear no, miss," he said.
"Oh, hullo, Tuppy," I said, "I wanted to see you."
"Oh, look," she said.
"Oh, my dear," he returned with a hopeless gesture.
"Oh, no;" answered the Woodman.
"Oh, poor child," said I; "let me out, if you please!"
"Oh, right ho," I said hastily.
"Oh, yes, it has, my dear," he said laughingly.
"Oh, yes; sit down in that chair, please," replied Oz.
"Oh, you'll be all right," I said.
"On the contrary," he replied.
"On the other hand you have four thousand francs," protested the detective.
"Only a matter of form, miss," returned the young gentleman.
"Only for the best, guardian," said I.
"Only round the corner," said Mr. Guppy.
"Over thirteen, sir," replied the child.
"Perfectly," said Adele in a malicious tone.
"Perhaps Helene has fainted," she said anxiously: "she does not come."
"Perhaps there are wild beasts in the forest now," said Dorothy.
"Precisely the same," said Mr. Badger.
"Probably," returns Mr. Tulkinghorn, quietly blowing his nose.
"Push that in at the first post office you pass," I said.
"Put the banknotes upon the table," he said hurriedly.
"Quick, Helene," said Celia. But Helene did not hurry.
"Quite so," said Adele comfortably.
"Quite," I replied guardedly.
"Quite," I said, a little hurriedly.
"Read it," he said.
"Remain a moment, Esther," said he, "You were in my thoughts."
"Richard," I urged, "it is not so hopeless as that?"
"Rick is mistaken, my dear," he would say to her.
"Right ho," I said.
"See," he continued, "you are wrong: she is coming."
"Send your valet away," he said.
"She has left her footmarks clear enough," he whispered.
"She has no need of it," said he.
"She is like the morning," he said.
"She is still weak," said the Commissaire.
"She looks honest," he said, with a sigh of relief.
"She means well," said Mr. Jarndyce hastily.
"She must be softened up," I said.
"She seems quite happy," he said.
"She should have come by the omnibus," he repeated and repeated stupidly.
"She will do all she can to make me happy," said I.
"She's worth her weight in gold," said the trooper.
"Shove it down, Aunt Dahlia," I said sympathetically.
"Silly young geezer," I said.
"So I gave him notice," said Mrs. Blinder.
"So it is, so it is," returned my guardian hurriedly.
"So it might," my guardian assented.
"So the name was Adele," he whispered.
"So you went at a walk," he said.
"So, cousin," said the cheerful voice of Richard to Ada behind me.
"Speak to Esther, my dearest," said Richard, breaking the silence presently.
"Still, she was not wearing them, I know," he said decisively.
"Summer lightning," he thought.
"Tails up be dashed," was her sombre response.
"Tails up, Aunt Dahlia," I urged buoyantly.
"Temporarily, yes," I had to admit.
"Thank you once more, mademoiselle," he said.
"Thank you," he answered.
"Thank you," he said, and the waiter moved away.
"Thank you," said Dorothy, gratefully.
"That is proof that he is sharp," remarked the Lion.
"That is quite true," he said.
"That is so," he said quietly.
"That is true," agreed the Woodman.
"That is true," said the doctor.
"That is your explanation, mademoiselle," he said gently.
"That man will take advice from no one," he declared.
"That must be a matter of opinion," said the Tin Woodman.
"That perhaps we shall see," he said.
"That very sleeve," he said, pointing.
"That was April Fool Day," says Mr. George, resuming his breakfast.
"That was just before I came," he said.
"That was madness," he said.
"That was me," said Mr. Bucket.
"That was not my meaning," returns Sir Leicester.
"That was the time, sir," answers Tony, faintly adjusting his whiskers.
"That we shall see," he said, pointing to the woodwork.
"That would make me very unhappy," answered the china princess.
"That's all right," said the Scarecrow.
"That's better," he said cheerfully.
"That's so cliche" she said.
"That's very like her," says Mr. Guppy.
"The Post Office would have stopped letters or telegrams," he said.
"The Silver Shoes," said the Good Witch, "have wonderful powers".
"The case is in your hands," said the Commissaire.
"The girl will know," said Helene.
"The interior of the room gaped black," he resumed.
"The universe," he observed, "makes rather an indifferent parent, I am afraid."
"Then I will tell him he may go tomorrow," said Celia.
"Then do it," he said with a smug grin.
"Then he can go jolly fast now," said Aunt Dahlia with animation.
"Then we will buy the cord in town," she said.
"Then why don't you —?" he began, and stopped.
"Then, cousin John —  " Ada laughingly began again.
"There are strong resemblances," he said guardedly.
"There had always been the row of footlights," she said.
"There has been no breach," I said.
"There is a pearl necklace missing," he said.
"There is nothing more for us to see here," he said.
"There is something cold there," said Tuppy, with growing cheerfulness.
"There it is," and he handed the man a five-franc piece.
"There we are," he said, with his shrill, wavering laugh.
"There will be danger, then?" he said, with a tremor of excitement.
"These are very fine," said my guardian.
"They are both friends of mine," he replied.
"They are crying it in the streets," said he.
"They die everywhere," said the boy.
"They know," he answered - "those in England know."
"They threaten me," said Harry.
"This is a horrible house," says Mr. Guppy, shutting the window.
"This is a lovely place," said Richard, looking round.
"This is a very sensible woman," said my guardian.
"This is my grandson," says Grandfather.
"This is my room," she said warningly, pointing to the bedroom.
"This is strange," exclaimed Dorothy; "what shall we do?"
"This," said my godmother in an undertone, "is the child."
"To be sure," said the judge, with a savage sarcasm.
"To me this story does not seem invented," he replied.
"To see the Good Witch who rules here," she answered.
"True," answered Oz.
"Up the hill to the Hotel Majestic," said Ricardo.
"Very good," I said coldly.
"Very good," said my guardian.
"Very well, mademoiselle," said Helene.
"Very well, my dear," said I.
"Very well," answered Oz, meekly.
"Very well," answered the little man.
"Very well," answered the little man; "I will get it for you."
"Very well," smiled Mrs. Badger, "we will say still young."
"We are doing very well," pursued Richard.
"We can't go back now," said Adele in a frantic whisper.
"We have had no such tests as these," she explained, half in hope.
"We have seen everything here; let us go upstairs," he said.
"We know that the murderer has escaped," he replied hotly.
"We must go," he whispered hoarsely.
"We must go," said Harry.
"We must go," said she.
"We must search Geneva, then," he cried.
"We need not keep this room locked," he said.
"We shall be in time, I think," he said.
"We shall go tomorrow morning," returned the Scarecrow.
"We will begin at the beginning," he said briskly.
"We will find her easily," said Harry.
"We will go and lunch," he said.
"We will proceed with the hearing on Wednesday fortnight," says the Chancellor.
"We will take a cab," she said: "it will save time."
"Well, Bertie, dear," she said, "here we all are."
"Well, Gussie," I said.
"Well, I'll tell you what I think," said the little man.
"Well, I'm glad you're feeling braced," I said.
"Well, Jeeves," I said, "it was certainly one of those afternoons."
"Well, if you say so," said Gussie doubtfully.
"Well, we will call her Adele," he said impatiently.
"What I think is this," he cried, flinging himself back.
"What have I to say?" he grumbled in a husky voice.
"What is the matter?" said Mr. Ricardo superbly.
"What the devil," he asked, "are you talking about?"
"Whatever you do, do not frighten her," he repeated.
"When it's ready, my dear," he replied.
"Who can read the heart?" "You can," returned Richard.
"Why, I must get a lodging of some sort," said Richard, pondering.
"Why, it's true," returns one of the policemen.
"Why, my dear," said I, "what beautiful flowers!"
"Why, my dear," she answered promptly, "of course it would!"
"Why, no, my dear," he replied.
"Why, not quite, my dear," said Mrs. Jellyby in the calmest manner.
"Why, now I'll tell you, Miss Summerson," he replied.
"Why, of course I am," said Richard, astonished at my simplicity.
"With pleasure," she answered, and brought a towel at once.
"Yes", said Hanaud, with a malicious smile.
"Yes", she said, with a pleased smile.
"Yes, Charley," said I, quietly putting up my hair.
"Yes, Charley," said Tom, "almost quite bright."
"Yes, I have heard of him," said Ada.
"Yes, I see that," he said dryly.
"Yes, and at once," cried Wethermill.
"Yes, indeed," repeats Sir Leicester.
"Yes, madame," answered the maid.
"Yes, monsieur," said Helene, recovering herself.
"Yes, of course," replied Oz.
"Yes, sir," she says, "really and truly."
"Yes, that is true," was the reply.
"Yes, that is very important," he said awkwardly.
"Yes, there are differences," he said.
"Yes, we happened to meet oftener," he returned.
"Yes, yes" - the words came now firm and clear.
"Yes, yes, you are tired," said he.
"Yes, yes," he said, in a soothing voice.
"Yes, you must not neglect that clue," he said.
"Yes, you," he said, turning round.
"Yes," he exclaimed, "what have you done?"
"Yes," he said pleasantly.
"Yes," he said, nodding his approval.
"Yes," he said; "so I thought you would decide."
"Yes," he snarled, "my wife's deaf."
"Yes," said Celia, "that will do very well."
"Yes," said Harry sullenly.
"Yes," said Mr. Ricardo eagerly.
"Yes," said the manager.
"Yes," said the old man abstractedly.
"Yes," says Mr. Tulkinghorn, coolly getting up and standing on the hearth.
"Yes," she said, nodding thoughtfully, "you're quite right."
"Yes; come to my hotel," said Harry.
"Yesterday evening's paper," he corrected.
"Yet the gravel was wet," he said, shaking his head.
"Yet there is perhaps, another explanation," he continued.
"Yonder, among the oak trees," said the tiger, pointing with his fore-foot.
"You are a jewel of a woman," said he.
"You are a vixen, a vixen!" she repeats with fierce disdain.
"You are better, mademoiselle," he said politely.
"You are out early, ma'am," said I as she curtsied to me.
"You are unusual," replied Glinda.
"You can trust her," she said in a trembling voice.
"You do," she said very shortly.
"You have been a soldier," observes Sir Leicester, "and a faithful one."
"You have found me out!" he cried, in mock alarm.
"You have plenty of courage, I am sure," answered Oz.
"You have won, monsieur," he said.
"You know I don't," said I.
"You may bring the letters," she says, "if you choose."
"You must come too," she said stubbornly.
"You must have a lawyer," pursued my guardian.
"You must have been thinking again," remarked the Tin Woodman.
"You needn't make a merit of that," said she.
"You promised you would blindfold the girl," he cried hoarsely.
"You reached your hotel at ten," he repeated.
"You romantic child," said she, lightly patting the girl's back.
"You said about ten," Tony repeats.
"You see, we shall find out nothing — nothing," said Harry, with a groan.
"You think I have begun ill, sir," retorted Richard.
"You will be present, Helene," she cried excitedly.
"You will excuse my having mentioned my daughters," he said.
"You will not, mademoiselle," he said.
"You will, perhaps, meet me tomorrow in Geneva," she said.
"Your Silver Shoes will carry you over the desert," replied Glinda.
"Your servant, sir," says Mr. George with a military salute.
'Bertie — let me go!' 'But I haven't got hold of you.'
'Can't you guess?' 'I'm dashed if I can.'
'Counsel’s Office,’ replied the executor in a whisper.
'Crawling out' is entirely the wrong way to put it.
'Defeatist' sums it up to a nicety.
'Do you hear?’ she continued.
'Don't do it!' she exclaimed, quivering in every limb.
'He did not check up' I said, champing contentedly.
'He is dead, sir.' 'Thank heaven for that.'

And Harry must listen to it.
And Helene answered him again enigmatically.
And Helene replied: "That one."
And Helene, even at that moment, laughed quietly.
And I added of my plenty about the same amount.
And I am very well indeed, and very happy.
And I continued to do so.
And I did not wish to quarrel with her.
And I do not wonder.
And I do so wish it was true!
And I don't blame you.
And I emitted a hard laugh — one of the sneering kind.
And I found it an interesting question.
And I have a liking for rust and must and cobwebs.
And I have her right hand.
And I have so many old parchments and papers in my stock.
And I haven’t sent the two messengers, either.
And I hope you've got plenty of chain out, Captain Young.
And I know brickmakers go about working at piecework in different places.
And I left before the finish.
And I made him my curtsy and left him.
And I meant it to sting.
And I must admit I rather agreed with her.
And I never saw him!
And I ran out into the garden, very unhappy.
And I said again, "I can't help it, Charley."
And I saw that he was very sorry for me.
And I saw them end.
And I should get cold feet if I tried again.
And I too, a little while ago.
And I understand she leads him a terrible life.
And I waited seven more days, and he never said a word.
And I was very lonely — my life had been so different.
And I will tell you more.
And I wish I'd never met one.
And I'll tell you why that will be the best plan.
And I’ll tell you a secret—I can read words of one letter!
And Jo stands shivering and looking at the breakfast wonderingly.
And MacDougall was beyond the trail, with three weeks to spare.
And Mr. Ricardo ticked off his third point.
And Paul admired and loved and despised him slightly.
And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house.
And Tom King patiently endured.
And a long time afterwards she brought her another supply.
And a nice brother he is — half-brother I mean to say.
And a second afterwards, a tiny bright light shone.
And actually here’s a little brook!
And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
And again I was troubled — greatly troubled.
And again her strange smile illuminated her face.
And again the appeal sounded rather piteously.
And all that stuff about having no soul.
And all the time her strange uneasiness grew.
And all through a foolish misunderstanding about a shark.
And all's fish that comes to my net.
And are you proposing to continue your stroll?
And as in denial of guilt, the one-legged boy replied.
And as never before, he was ready to obey.
And as the reflection darted across my mind I saw a slender chance.
And as we hurried up town, Joe Goose explained.
And at dinner you will push, as arranged?
And at once Celia became uneasy.
And at the same time I could save her from being plundered.
And at this moment a ringing "Hoy!"
And at this moment in she came.
And back to Kansas? she asked, eagerly.
And can all the flowers talk?
And closing his eyes, he began trying to cross his legs again.
And couldn't the sergeant see that my door was locked?
And curtsey while you’re thinking what to—what to purr.
And do you always lock the babies up when you go out?
And do you know why he tried to dissuade me?
And do you live alone here with these babies, Charley?
And do you often go out?
And do you think Mr. Woodcourt will make another voyage?
And don't you occupy yourself at all?
And don’t keep your mouth so wide open!
And don’t remind me of your existence again.
And each year something happened, and I did not go.
And enough to make it.
And even as she spoke her voice rang shrill and irritable up the stairs.
And even if they don't — Bertie, shall I tell you something?
And even now, with this case, I hesitate.
And even then she was dazed.
And every one will think that Celia helped to murder and rob her benefactress.
And give her the works.
And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
And have the children looked after themselves at all, sir?
And he did hurt my arm.
And he flung up his hands.
And he had not come disguised.
And he had shown himself a fool.
And he has done nothing to embarrass us.
And he is very great this day.
And he moved towards the staircase.
And he opened his hand.
And he opened the door.
And he passed on without another question or remark.
And he raised no hand to set her free.
And he replaced the glass in his pocket.
And he spread out his hands with an impulsive gesture of despair.
And he thought of Oona, and of her words.
And he touched the tins.
And he turned and walked by Helene's side.
And he walked away.
And he was at pains to write it out.
And he was filled with a strange and foreboding fear.
And he was too far gone to be helped out of that.
And he will come back enlightened.
And he'll be in the same scrape again next week!
And he's just the same today.
And her voice sank into a solemn whisper, pathetically ludicrous.
And her voice was feverish.
And here's another idea.
And here, she is seized with an inspiration.
And his answering immediately to the last question.
And his behaviour, so strikingly altered — what could it mean?
And his eyes had been horribly intelligent.
And his father is dependent on him in the Vale of Taunton.
And his sisters are charming women.
And how about this pessimism we hear of?
And how can I pay?
And how did he react to that?
And how did you like Mrs. Jellyby, my dear?
And how did you like the ride?
And how did you reassure him?
And how do you come to be the messenger?
And how do you find yourself, my poor lad?
And how do you get on, Richard?
And how do you live, Charley?
And how fast it comes!
And how have I destroyed it?
And how is your mama?
And how long did this nuisance continue?
And how odd the directions will look!
And how quiet the horses are!
And how would we ever find ourselves.
And if anything happens while we dine?
And if that were true — why, there were my sofa cushions partly explained.
And if they are, it's worth nothing to me.
And in a second he was back at the window.
And in his mind he added: "God forgive me for the lie."
And in the darkness his voice came querulously between long breaths.
And in the fullness of that knowledge a great fear assailed her.
And indeed he has no such wish at present.
And it had taken so long — so terribly long!
And it is a good likeness?
And it might lead to mistaken notions, you see.
And it really was a kitten, after all.
And it was as I had suspected.
And it's no good looking like that.
And it's still at it.
And mind you tell us the truth here, whatever you do, Jo.
And my mind requires to be so very clear, you know!
And no doubt he will.
And no wonder in this evil place.
And not upon my words.
And not you, I swear!
And nothing was wrung from her.
And now I don't so much care how it ends.
And now I will ask you a question in return.
And now behold the perversity of things.
And now he too could look in.
And now help me on.
And now here is a minor point.
And now it's nearly dinner-time, you say?
And now put yourself in my place for a moment.
And now she lies in her room murdered!
And now she lies murdered for a reward!
And now she was sure that Adele was the name used.
And now you stammer out those halting words.
And now you’d better go!
And now, Bertie, like a good chap, shove off.
And now, down there, Eileen was waiting for him.
And now, who am I?
And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds!
And one, I tell you, is coming now.
And only one for birthday presents, you know.
And poor Mr. Darcy!
And pray has he done so?
And pray what sort of guardians do you make?
And really, for so smart a young lady, you look too ridiculous.
And right there I saw and knew it all.
And said he played the fife.
And she caught her breath and whimpered.
And she could not.
And she had not told Harry!
And she handed the paper back.
And she has been very kind to me.
And she hung it on a nail in the kitchen.
And she kept her word?
And she laid the keys upon the dressing-table or the mantel-shelf.
And she moved towards the stairs.
And she named a small cafe in a back street.
And she passed on, leaving Harry rooted to the ground.
And she really never heard of the cause!
And she tied the girl's thumbs and little fingers.
And she was getting medicine for him?
And she was never caught out!
And she’s such a capital one for catching mice you can’t think!
And so Esther, my dear, you are happy for life.
And so did Mrs. Forster.
And so early in the voyage, too.
And so extremely accomplished for her age!
And so for a while we spoke of neutral topics.
And so it was arranged.
And so the seances went on.
And so the state of the car is explained.
And so we all moved to the village.
And so we danced an hour by the clock.
And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to apply.
And so you like this man's sisters, too, do you?
And so young a girl to be involved in it!
And still Celia slept.
And still there was the same shade between me and my darling.
And suddenly his face grew very stern.
And suddenly she smiled.
And suddenly, Mr. Ricardo began to reflect.
And thank you very much for asking,’ said Tweedledum.
And that afternoon he had to take them.
And that is not all.
And that was like me!
And that was the last of Francois and Perrault.
And that's how I know how.
And the Edinburgh Evening News says, with editorial gloom.
And the Eurasian Chinese-Englishman bowed himself away.
And the Queen seemed to guess her thoughts, for she cried, ‘Faster!’
And the agitated voice and words remained fixed in his memory.
And the air was growing chilly.
And the best of it was that they did not even know my name.
And the big Persian knew of his existence before he did of hers.
And the chef is staying on.
And the detective resumed at once his brisk voice and alert manner.
And the foundation stone of service, in his case, was obedience.
And the frock in which she went away was of green chiffon over satin.
And the letters are destroyed with the person?
And the night had fallen.
And the other thing is a mouse-trap.
And the question was her answer.
And the tears swam in her eyes.
And their chief virtue lies in that they will never wear out.
And then I found myself looking down the skylight.
And then I said my prayers and thought a little more.
And then I suddenly got it.
And then I think I became unconscious.
And then a thing incomprehensible to her happened.
And then he discussed his sweetheart endlessly with his mother.
And then he spoke again in French to Helene.
And then one was at school with the man.
And then she answered you, 'No, we have other plans.'
And then suddenly a sort of glow came into his face.
And then the real truth flashed in upon her blindingly.
And then there came a strange and human turn to the affair.
And then we were so merry all the way home!
And then when we came away it was such fun!
And then you go on about how twilight always makes you sad.
And then, steadily, he began to chew.
And there I see him waiting to be summoned.
And there is my slit in the sofa cushions.
And there is no way round.
And there was Ethel Baird, whom also you must remember.
And there was a dog that barked.
And there was science to an unlimited extent.
And there you are, my partner, eh?
And there you sit, I suppose, all the day long, eh?
And there's no chivalry, no quarter shown in this fight.
And there's not such another.
And they are very angry?
And they have shot him.
And they passed on.
And they used to dance like elves of delight.
And this belief grew and haunted him.
And this extraordinary man took up his pen again.
And this is brother, is it, my dears?
And this is not a conspiracy, perhaps?
And this is your establishment?
And this was their sole conversation throughout the meal.
And through and through the vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
And through the chinks in the curtain the bright light shone.
And to attend the court no more?
And to be kept back on such a motive!
And to drink? Name the poison.
And to give no sign!
And to me that would mean so much.
And toddle off quite happily to find another.
And tomorrow night, they will come into my possession.
And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows.
And upon that a worse thing befell her.
And upon that the voice ceased.
And very much indebted to you.
And very well indeed you are looking.
And watch out for wet feet, was his parting advice.
And we have hardly a five-franc piece in the house.
And we know that she was back at the villa soon after nine.
And we like 'em all the better for it, don't we?
And we shall find out where the rest is hid — from her.
And well you may.
And what I say unto you, I say unto all, Watch!
And what about my side of the thing?
And what are you crying for?
And what did she do with the keys?
And what do you call these, my darling?
And what do you intend to make of him, ma'am?
And what do you know?
And what do you suppose it's made of?
And what do you think about father?
And what else do we know?
And what is he to do then?
And what may be the ages of these two, ma'am?
And what of his daughters?
And what sort of table do they keep?
And what sort of young lady is she?

And yet if she came he had no words to say.
And yet it is quite simple.
And yet not quite, as you shall hear.

And you are to go down at twelve?

And, in truth, she was not afraid of them.
And, mind this, one of the two women is guilty.
And, so far as they knew, they were quite right.
And, springing up, he arranged a chair for her.
And, what's more, you know it.
And, with a friendly nod, he left the room.

I shall be a different man altogether in the country.
I shall be a mockery and a scorn.
I shall be a riot.
I shall be within the mark any way.
I shall come all right again, then, don't you be afraid.
I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.
I shall have to be very careful.
I shall help you.
I shall make the order.
I shall never be able to ask her to marry me.
I shall never forget her appearance this morning.
I shall never forgive myself — never, never!
I shall never get to twenty at that rate!
I shall not be able to keep you — and so I warn you.

I shook it, and it seemed rather flimsy.
I shook my head, wondering even what it was.
I shot a glance at Jeeves.
I should be available this afternoon

I should be sent to prison, I suppose, when the day came.
I should have brought mine.
I should have moved to one side. I did not reply.

I should not be content.
I should wish to speak to you first.
I shouldn't have been fit for it.
I shouldn't wonder if we found a ginger-bread soldier downstairs.
I shout that every single day!
I simply could not accept his hospitality on false pretences.
I simply said nothing, and stood there looking brave.
I simply stared at him and stuttered.
I slackened speed some yards off and walked briskly up to the door.
I smoked in a chair till daylight, for I could not sleep.
I snapped the switch, but there was nobody there.
I soon found myself very busy.
I speak feelingly.
I speak the common tongue.
I spend my wealth on philanthropic efforts.
I spent a warm and peaceful afternoon.
I spent all day in the park.
I spent some time looking around to get my bearings.
I spoke to him, and got an answer in the soft dialect of Essex.
I stared at him, speechless.
I stared at the man dumbly.
I stared at the man, astounded.
I stared at the man.
I stayed at my post till five o’clock.
I stole quietly along the drive.
I stood awhile in thought.
I stood looking at him in silence.
I stuffed my fishing-rod into his jaws, and I had a pistol.
I suffer from arthritis.
I suffer from carpal tunnel syndrome.
I suppose it was that word "upset" that touched Aunt Dahlia off.
I suppose it was, for he went away.
I suppose nobody ever was in such a state of ink.
I suppose she cursed me properly?
I suppose that no one has been allowed to enter the room?
I suppose we must make the best of it!
I suppose you have some settled home.
I suppose you might say that all's well that ends well.
I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
I suppose you were an excellent son.
I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
I suppose, as a matter of fact, Jeeves suggested it.
I supposed the room was empty.
I suppress names for the present.
I take it as a compliment.
I take it you believe in love at first sight?
I take loads of selfies.
I talked freely when that man was here.
I talked to one of the guides – very knowledgeable.
I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot.

I tell you I’m fair sick of it.
I tell you it does.
I tell you something more now.
I tell you this is no ordinary blundering affair.
I thank my honourable friend for that cheer.
I thank you all the same, sir, but — no lawyer!
I thank you for explaining it so fully.
I thank you with all my heart.
I thank you, no, not a morsel.

I think it is pretty.
I think it is rather our way to be in earnest.
I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
I think she's organising some sort of do.
I think that may be important.
I think the poor mutt's loony.

I think the worse of him?
I think they meant to kill me.
I think we had better talk about this, really, Ada.
I think we have to agree that he didn't mean it.
I think we may assume that he has every detail stamped on his mind.
I think we'd better keep mum about that.
I think we’re in a strong position
I think you had better leave me, Jeeves.
I think you're protesting much over nothing really, although I could be wrong.

whispered Miss Jellyby, drawing my arm tighter through her own.
whispered Richard, not thinking she could hear him.
‘A cat may look at a king,’ said Alice.
‘A dear little crab!’ thought Alice.
‘A fine day, your Majesty!’ the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.
‘A likely story indeed!’ said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt.
‘A little—a little,’ the King replied, rather nervously.
‘A quarter to two,’ he said, looking at the parlour clock.
‘Ah, what is it, now?’ the Unicorn cried eagerly.
‘Ahem!’ said the Mouse with an important air, ‘are you all ready?’
‘All round the town?’ he said.
‘And darker,’ said Tweedledee.
‘And how did you manage on the twelfth?’ Alice went on eagerly.
‘And washing?’ said the Mock Turtle.
‘And what enormous flowers they must be!’ was her next idea.
‘And you were all the better for it, I know!’ the Queen said triumphantly.
‘Another sandwich!’ said the King.
‘Anything you like,’ said the Footman, and began whistling.
‘Are their heads off?’ shouted the Queen.
‘Are there any lions or tigers about here?’ she asked timidly.
‘Are there many crabs here?’ said Alice.
‘Are we nearly there?’ Alice managed to pant out at last.
‘Are you animal—vegetable—or mineral?’ he said, yawning at every other word.
‘Are you content now?’ said the Caterpillar.
‘Are you to get in at all?’ said the Footman.
‘As well as you can,’ said the Tiger-lily.
‘Blew—me—up,’ panted the Queen, who was still a little out of breath.
‘But I’m not a serpent, I tell you!’ said Alice.
‘But I’m not used to it!’ pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.
‘But about his toes?’ the Mock Turtle persisted.
‘But she must have a prize herself, you know,’ said the Mouse.
‘By-the-bye, what became of the baby?’ said the Cat.
‘Call it what you like,’ said the Cat.
‘Call the next witness!’ said the King.
‘Can you answer useful questions?’ she said.
‘Can you guess why I did that?’ he said to Alice.
‘Can you keep from crying by considering things?’ she asked.
‘Can’t you?’ the Queen said in a pitying tone.
‘Capital dinners he gave; fine port, too,’ he remarked.
‘Certainly not!’ said Alice indignantly.
‘Change engines—’ it said, and was obliged to leave off.
‘Change lobsters again!’ it yelled at the top of its voice.
‘Check!’ and Alice looked round in some surprise for the new enemy.
‘Collar that Dormouse,’ the Queen shrieked out.
‘Come back!’ the Caterpillar called after her.
‘Come, it’s pleased so far,’ thought Alice, and she went on.
‘Come, let’s try the first figure!’ said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon.
‘Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!’ thought Alice.
‘Come, you look rather better now!’ she said, after altering most of the pins.
‘Consider your verdict,’ he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.
‘Dear me, no!’ said the King.
‘Did you say pig, or fig?’ said the Cat.
‘Did you say “What a pity!”?’ the Rabbit asked.
‘Digging for apples, indeed!’ said the Rabbit angrily.
‘Ditto, ditto’ cried Tweedledee.
‘Do I look like it?’ he said.
‘Does the boots and shoes!’ she repeated in a wondering tone.
‘Don’t let us quarrel,’ the White Queen said in an anxious tone.
‘Each with a lobster as a partner!’ it cried.
‘Exactly so,’ said Alice.
‘Faster!’ and dragged her along.
‘Feather!’ cried the Sheep, as she took up another pair of needles.
‘Fiddle-de-dee’s not English,’ Alice replied gravely.
‘Fifteenth,’ said the March Hare.
‘Fivepence farthing for one—Twopence for two,’ the Sheep replied.
‘Fourteenth of March, I think it was,’ he said.
‘Give your evidence,’ said the King.
‘Good-bye, till we meet again!’ she said as cheerfully as she could.
‘Hand it over here,’ said the Dodo.
‘Have some wine,’ the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.
‘Hay, then,’ the King murmured in a faint whisper.
‘He must have been fast asleep,’ whispered Mr. Tupman.
‘He must have imitated somebody else’s hand,’ said the King.
‘He took me for his housemaid,’ she said to herself as she ran.
‘Herald, read the accusation!’ said the King.
‘Hold your tongue!’ cried the Tiger-lily.
‘Hold your tongue!’ it added, before Alice could speak again.
‘How am I to get in?’ asked Alice again, in a louder tone.
‘How can I have done that?’ she thought.
‘How can she knit with so many?’ the puzzled child thought to herself.
‘How do you know I’m mad?’ said Alice.
‘How dreadfully savage!’ exclaimed Alice.
‘How should I know?’ said Alice, surprised at her own courage.
‘However, I know my name now.’ she said, ‘that’s some comfort’.
‘I am so sleepy?’ she moaned.
‘I beg your pardon?’ said Alice.
‘I call it purring, not growling,’ said Alice.
‘I deny it!’ said the March Hare.
‘I don’t know what you mean,’ said Alice.
‘I don’t know what you mean,’ she said.
‘I don’t know,’ Alice said doubtfully.
‘I don’t much care where—’ said Alice.
‘I don’t quite know yet,’ Alice said, very gently.
‘I don’t quite understand you,’ she said, as politely as she could.
‘I don’t see any wine,’ she remarked.
‘I hope you’re a good hand at pinning and tying strings?’ Tweedledum remarked.
‘I like birthday presents best,’ she said at last.
‘I like them when they can talk,’ Alice said.
‘I mean what I say,’ the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone.
‘I must have two—to fetch and carry.
‘I never bet half a dozen!’ said the other.
‘I never saw one, or heard of one,’ said Alice.
‘I never thought of that before!’ she said.
‘I only hope the boat won’t tipple over!’ she said to herself.
‘I only meant that I didn’t understand,’ said Alice.
‘I only took the regular course.’
‘I only wish I had such eyes,’ the King remarked in a fretful tone.
‘I said there was nothing like it.’ Which Alice did not venture to deny.
‘I see somebody now!’ she exclaimed at last.
‘I see you don’t,’ said Alice.
‘I should like to buy an egg, please,’ she said timidly.
‘I should like to have it explained,’ said the Mock Turtle.
‘I should like to hear her try and repeat something now.
‘I should win easy,’ said the Lion.
‘I suppose so,’ said Alice.
‘I talk English, don’t I?’ the Frog went on.
‘I think I may as well go in at once.’ And in she went.
‘I thought it would,’ said the Cat, and vanished again.
‘I thought you did,’ said the Mouse.
‘I was coming to that,’ the Knight said.
‘I wish I knew!’ thought poor Alice.
‘I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?’ she said aloud.
‘I wonder if all the things move along with us?’ thought poor puzzled Alice.
‘I won’t!’ said Alice.
‘If I’d meant that, I’d have said it,’ said Humpty Dumpty.
‘Indeed I did,’ said Alice: ‘you’ve said it very often—and very loud.
‘Is that all?’ Alice timidly asked.
‘Is that all?’ said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she could.
‘Is that the reason so many tea-things are put out here?’ she asked.
‘Isn’t he a lovely sight?’ said Tweedledum.
‘It all came different!’ the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully.
‘It always happens,’ said the gnat.
‘It began with blotting paper,’ the Knight answered with a groan.
‘It began with the tea,’ the Hatter replied.
‘It can talk,’ said he, solemnly.
‘It can’t be anybody else!’ she said to herself.
‘It does the boots and shoes,’ it replied very solemnly.
‘It gets easier further on,’ Humpty Dumpty replied.
‘It is striking four,’ I answered.
‘It is well you are out of my reach,’ he exclaimed.
‘It isn’t mine,’ said the Hatter.
‘It isn’t respectable to beg,’ said the King.
‘It must be a very pretty dance,’ said Alice timidly.
‘It proves nothing of the sort!’ said Alice.
‘It sounds like a horse,’ Alice thought to herself.
‘It was all kinds of fastness with me, I can assure you!’ he said.
‘It was the best butter,’ the March Hare meekly replied.
‘It’s a fabulous monster!’ the Unicorn cried out, before Alice could reply.
‘It’s exactly like a riddle with no answer!’ she thought.
‘It’s only the Red King snoring,’ said Tweedledee.
‘It’s really dreadful,’ she muttered to herself, ‘the way all the creatures argue’.
‘It’s—it’s a very fine day!’ said a timid voice at her side.
‘I’d rather see that done on paper,’ he said.
‘I’ll fetch the executioner myself,’ said the King eagerly, and he hurried off.
‘I’ll get one,’ the Knight said thoughtfully to himself.
‘I’ll tell you how I came to think of it,’ said the Knight.
‘I’m a poor man, your Majesty,’ he began.
‘I’m glad I’ve seen that done,’ thought Alice.
‘I’m not a mile high,’ said Alice.
‘I’m not a serpent!’ said Alice indignantly.
‘I’m not a visitor, and I’m not a servant.
‘I’m not offended,’ said Humpty Dumpty.
‘I’m not so sure of that,’ said the Unicorn.
‘I’ve got it!’ she cried in a triumphant tone.
‘Keep your temper,’ said the Caterpillar.
‘Leave off that!’ screamed the Queen.
‘Look, look!’ she cried, pointing eagerly.
‘Must a name mean something?’ Alice asked doubtfully.
‘Nearly there!’ the Queen repeated.
‘Nearly two miles high,’ added the Queen.
‘Never mind!’ said the King, with an air of great relief.
‘Never!’ said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke.
‘No use, no use!’ said the King.
‘No, I don’t think it is,’ he said: ‘at least—not under here’.
‘No, Mr. Lockwood,’ said Nelly, shaking her head.
‘No, it can’t,’ said the Queen.
‘No, no!’ said the Queen.
‘No, you don’t understand,’ the Knight said, looking a little vexed.
‘No,’ said the Caterpillar.
‘Nobody said you did,’ said the Red Queen.
‘Nobody,’ said the messenger.
‘Nonsense!’ said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was silent.
‘Nor I,’ said the March Hare.
‘Not I!’ he replied.
‘Not at all,’ gruffly remarked the elder man.
‘Not at all,’ said the King.
‘Not yet, not yet!’ the Rabbit hastily interrupted.
‘Not yet,’ said the Knight.
‘Not you!’ Tweedledee retorted contemptuously.
‘Nothing whatever,’ said Alice.
‘Nothing whatever?’ persisted the King.
‘Nothing!’ Alice said impatiently.
‘Nothing,’ said Alice.
‘Now!’ cried the Queen.
‘Now, Kitty!’ she cried, clapping her hands triumphantly.
‘Of course twinkling begins with a T!’ said the King sharply.
‘Of course you agree to have a battle?’ Tweedledum said in a calmer tone.
‘Of course you don’t!’ the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously.
‘Of course,’ the Dodo replied very gravely.
‘Off with her head!’ the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.
‘Off with his head!’ she said, without even looking round.
‘Oh, don’t talk about trouble!’ said the Duchess.
‘Oh, hush!’ the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone.
‘Oh, it’s too bad!’ she cried.
‘Oh, no, Sir,’ replied Mary eagerly.
‘Oh, you can’t help that,’ said the Cat: ‘we’re all mad here’.
‘Oh, you foolish Alice!’ she answered herself.
‘Oh, you sing,’ it said.
‘One, indeed!’ said the Dormouse indignantly.
‘Only a thimble,’ said Alice sadly.
‘Only in the usual way,’ Alice said, smiling.
‘Only you must eat them both, if you buy two,’ said the Sheep.
‘Open the bag!’ he whispered.
‘Please, would you tell me what you call yourself?’ she said timidly.
‘Please, would you tell me—’ she began, looking timidly at the Red Queen.
‘Pray don’t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,’ said Alice.
‘Quite right,’ said the King: ‘this young lady saw him too’.
‘Repeat, “You are old, Father William,”’ said the Caterpillar.
‘Sap and sawdust,’ said the gnat.
‘Serpent!’ screamed the Pigeon.
‘Seven years and six months!’ Humpty Dumpty repeated thoughtfully.
‘Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?’ it went on.
‘Shan’t,’ said the cook.
‘She boxed the Queen’s ears—’ the Rabbit began.
‘She can’t do addition,’ the Red Queen interrupted.
‘She can’t explain it,’ it said hastily.
‘She’s all right again now,’ said the Red Queen.
‘She’s coming!’ cried the Larkspur.
‘She’s grown a good deal!’ was her first remark.
‘She’s my prisoner, you know!’ the Red Knight said at last.
‘She’s tired, poor thing!’ said the Red Queen.
‘Show your ticket, child!’ the Guard went on, looking angrily at Alice.
‘Sixteenth,’ added the Dormouse.
‘So much obliged!’ added Tweedledee.
‘Speak when you’re spoken to!’ The Queen sharply interrupted her.
‘Speak, can’t you?’ he cried impatiently.
‘Speak, won’t you!’ cried the King.
‘Stand up and repeat “‘Tis the voice of the sluggard,”’ it said.
‘Stuff and nonsense!’ said Alice loudly.
‘Suppose we change the subject,’ the March Hare interrupted, yawning.
‘Supposing it couldn’t find any?’ she suggested.
‘Swim after them!’ it screamed.
‘Take a bone from a dog: what remains?’ Alice considered.
‘Take care!’ cried Alice.
‘Take off your hat,’ the King said to the Hatter.
‘Thank you very much,’ said Alice.
‘Thank you,’ said Alice, ‘it’s very interesting’.
‘That I can’t remember,’ said the Hatter.
‘That accounts for the bleeding, you see,’ she said to Alice with a smile.
‘That proves his guilt,’ said the Queen.
‘That seems to be done right—’ he began.
‘That’s all,’ said Humpty Dumpty.
‘That’s hardly enough,’ he said, anxiously.
‘That’s just what I complain of,’ said Humpty Dumpty.
‘That’s none of your business, Two!’ said Seven.
‘That’s right!’ said the Tiger-lily.
‘That’s right!’ shouted the Queen.
‘That’s very curious!’ she thought.
‘That’s very important,’ the King said, turning to the jury.
‘The daisies are worst of all.
‘Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!’ the soldiers shouted in reply.
‘Then if the dog went away, its temper would remain!’ the Queen exclaimed triumphantly.
‘Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,’ said the Cat.
‘Then it ought to be Number One,’ said Alice.
‘Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,’ said Alice angrily.
‘Then the Dormouse shall!’ they both cried.
‘Then you should say what you mean,’ the March Hare went on.
‘There isn’t any,’ said the March Hare.
‘There’s nothing but hay left now,’ the Messenger said, peeping into the bag.
‘They are going to the Grange, then?’ I said.
‘They are, they are,’ ejaculated Mr. Tupman; ‘but not all men'.
‘They lived on treacle,’ said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or two.
‘Thinking again?’ the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp little chin.
‘Three hundred and sixty-five,’ said Alice.
‘Tickets, please!’ said the Guard, putting his head in at the window.
‘To answer the door?’ he said.
‘To be sure I do.’ said Alice.
‘To guard against the bites of sharks,’ the Knight replied.
‘Too proud?’ the other inquired.
‘Treacle,’ said a sleepy voice behind her.
‘Treacle,’ said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.
‘Turn a somersault in the sea!’ cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly about.
‘Tut, tut, child!’ said the Duchess.
‘Very much indeed,’ said Alice.
‘Very true,’ said the Duchess: ‘flamingoes and mustard both bite’.
‘Very,’ said Alice: ‘—where’s the Duchess?’
‘Wake up, Dormouse!’ And they pinched it on both sides at once.
‘We wanted to plant some flowers there,’ she cried.
‘Well, only on Thursdays,’ said the Queen.
‘Well, this is grand!’ said Alice.
‘Well—yes—a little,’ Alice replied gently.
‘We’d better take it with us,’ the Knight said.
‘What a curious helmet you’ve got!’ she said cheerfully.
‘What a funny watch!’ she remarked.
‘What a number of cucumber-frames there must be!’ thought Alice.
‘What a thick black cloud that is!’ she said.
‘What are they doing?’ Alice whispered.
‘What can all that green stuff be?’ said Alice.
‘What do you call yourself?’ the Fawn said at last.
‘What do you know about this business?’ the King said to Alice.
‘What does it matter where my body happens to be?’ he said.
‘What else have you got in your pocket?’ he went on, turning to Alice.
‘What fun!’ it said, half to itself, half to Alice.
‘What impertinence!’ said the pudding.
‘What is it, now?’ the Frog said in a deep hoarse whisper.
‘What is the fun?’ said Alice.
‘What is the matter, my little man?’ I asked.
‘What is this?’ he said at last.
‘What size do you want to be?’ it asked.
‘What sort of things do you remember best?’ Alice ventured to ask.
‘What was that?’ inquired Alice.
‘What’s that you say?’ - pretending that the kitten was speaking.
‘Where do you come from?’ said the Red Queen.
‘Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?’ he asked.
‘Which door?’ said the Frog.
‘Who are at it again?’ she ventured to ask.
‘Who are you?’ said the Caterpillar.
‘Who ever said it was?’ said the Red Queen.
‘Who’s making personal remarks now?’ the Hatter asked triumphantly.
‘Why all round her head, of course,’ the Rose replied.
‘Why not?’ said the March Hare.
‘Why the Lion and the Unicorn, of course,’ said the King.
‘Why, I’ve done all the screaming already,’ said the Queen.
‘Why, because there’s nobody with me!’ cried Humpty Dumpty.
‘Why, she,’ it said.
‘Why, what are your shoes done with?’ it said.
‘Would it be of any use, now,’ thought Alice, ‘to speak to this mouse?
‘Would you like to see a little of it?’ said the Mock Turtle.
‘Yes!’ shouted Alice.
‘Yes, but then I came and rescued her!’ the White Knight replied.
‘Yes, if you like,’ said Alice.
‘Yes, please do!’ pleaded Alice.
‘Yes, pretty well—some poetry,’ Alice said doubtfully.
‘Yes,’ said Alice, ‘we learned French and music.’
‘You alarm me!’ said the King.
‘You are,’ said the King.
‘You can,’ replied Mr. Snodgrass.
‘You did!’ said the Hatter.
‘You did,’ said the Mock Turtle.
‘You don’t know what you’re talking about!’ cried Humpty Dumpty.
‘You must hit the trees pretty often, I should think,’ she said.
‘You seem very clever at explaining words, Sir,’ said Alice.
‘You take some flour—’ ‘Where do you pick the flower?’ the White Queen asked.
‘You’d better not talk!’ said Five.
‘You’re a very poor speaker,’ said the King.
‘You’re holding it upside down!’ Alice interrupted.
‘You’re thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk.
‘You’ve been wrong!’ cried Tweedledum.
‘You’ve missed the soup and fish,’ she said.
‘—so long as I get somewhere,’ Alice added as an explanation.
“A bet,” I said.
“A ripping speech,” he said.
“A thousand thanks,” I said.
“Ah!” cried Miriam, and she looked at Paul, her dark eyes dilating.
“All right,” I said.
“And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?” said Mrs. Gardiner.
“And is this all?” cried Elizabeth.
“And that’s all I get,” he moaned.
“And this is always the way with him,” she added.
“And what better chance could you ask?” I cried.
“Are you Alexander Turnbull?” he asked.
“Are you still at school?” asked Miriam of Beatrice.
“At your service,” he said politely.
“Because you were engrossed with Miriam,” replied she hotly.
“Beg pardon, Sir Harry,” said one.
“Bob’s got to go to town tonight,” he added, turning to me.
“Brazen hussy!” said she to Paul.
“But I don’t see,” he went on.
“But I’m a strong teetotaller,” he said pugnaciously.
“But he always gets better,” said Paul after a while.
“But what is to be done about Pemberley?” cried Mrs. Gardiner.
“By God, the murderer!” he cried.
“Can I speak to you?” he said.
“Can the dispositions not be changed?” I asked.
“Can this be Mr. Darcy?” thought she.
“Can you deny that you have done it?” she repeated.
“Can’t you trust us, mother?” he repeated, rather offended.
“Clear, isn’t it?” he said pleasantly.
“Come here, child,” cried her father as she appeared.
“Come in here a moment,” I said.
“Consider,” he said.
“Did you tell him what has happened?” he asked.
“Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?” said she.
“Do you like singing?” Miriam asked her.
“Do you swim?” said Paul.
“Do you wonder?” he cried.
“Does the new Surveyor know you?” I asked.
“Don’t get flustered, uncle,” he said.
“Don’t you see it’s a clue,” I shouted.
“Father!” said Paul, so that the word rang.
“First turn to the right up by the long fir-wood,” he enjoined.
“From Rhodesia, you remember.” “Good God, the murderer!” he choked.
“Good evening to you,” he said gravely.
“Good,” said Sir Harry.
“Have they gone?” I asked.
“He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,” said her uncle.
“He is safe,” he cried.
“He must be an oddity, I think,” said she.
“Hello!” he said, seeing Paul bareheaded.
“Here!” piped Paul, small and inadequate.
“Here’s the most I can make of it,” I said.
“His father was an excellent man,” said Mrs. Gardiner.
“How Nellie will chuckle,” said the plump man.
“How nicely we are all crammed in,” cried Lydia.
“Hullo, Jopley,” I sang out.
“I am afraid he must put off his journey,” I said.
“I am thinking of what you have been telling me,” said she.
“I apologise to the shade of Scudder,” he said.
“I call it disgraceful,” he said, raising his voice.
“I can’t, guv’nor,” I said in a real beggar’s whine.
“I do not know when I have been more shocked,” said she.
“I don’t know what to make of it,” he said at last.
“I don’t know what you mean,” I said roughly.
“I have spoken to him,” he said.
“I meant to say, Yes.” I had forgotten all about my alias.
“I must see Sir Walter,” I panted.
“I see what you are feeling,” replied Charlotte.
“I see your design, Bingley,” said his friend.
“I want a word with you.” And I led him into the dining-room.
“I want it in five minutes,” he said.
“I want to write books,” he said.
“I wasn't up very early,” I said.
“I will call him Paul,” she said suddenly; she knew not why.
“I will tell you a tale,” he said.
“I'll see you get your papers in good time,” he said.
“If one could but go to Brighton!” observed Mrs. Bennet.
“Indeed I have, sir,” was her answer.
“Insolent girl!” said Elizabeth to herself.
“Is his Lordship at home?” I asked.
“Is it as late as that, mother?” he said.
“Is that place an inn?” I asked.
“Isn’t he shameless, Miriam?” “Quite,” said Miriam.
“It doesn’t hurt a bit,” said Paul.
“It’s a chance,” he said.
“It’s a wild road, mother,” said Paul.
“It’s easy speaking,” he moaned.
“It’s got to be more retired than that,” I said.
“It’s up the entry,” said Paul.
“I’ll light her the candle, mother,” he said.
“I’m a colonial and travel light.” “A colonial,” he cried.
“I’m going to teach Miriam algebra,” he said.
“I’m very sorry,” he said humbly.
“I’ve brought you the Portland Place murderer,” was Sir Walter’s introduction.
“Let us get on,” he said.
“Let us sit here a minute,” said Miriam.
“Let’s see,” said Paul.
“Listen, Sir Harry,” I said.
“Look at the time,” said the old man.
“Maybe, maybe,” said the old man.
“Meantime I vote we have a game of bridge,” said the plump one.
“Mining engineer,” I said.
“Morning,” said the last.
“Mr Hannay?” he said hesitatingly.
“Mr Scudder...” I stammered.
“My blame, sir,” I answered him.
“My business is desperately important.” That butler was a great man.
“My name’s Hannay,” I said.
“No,” I said.
“No,” said the Frenchman.
“Nonsense!” said the official from the Admiralty.
“Now let us have the little note-book,” said Sir Walter.
“Now, don’t waste it,” said the mother.
“Of course I do,” and he held out his hand.
“Oh no,” replied Miriam, without looking at him.
“Oh, Chubby!” Then she turned with that sweetish smile to she.
“Oh, damn,” said the young man.
“Oh, for God’s sake stop jawing,” I cried.
“Oh, how do you do, she!” she exclaimed.
“Pardon,” he said, “I’m a bit rattled tonight”.
“Quick!” cried Beatrice, giving Paul the scraped loaf.
“Scotland Yard,” I said.
“See here,” I whispered.
“She makes me feel uncomfortable,” said Paul.
“Should we go, mother?” he said.
“So?” he said, still smiling.
“Stop that row, Paddock,” I said.
“Tea is ready, mother,” she said in a musical, quiet voice.
“That’s what I tell him,” said the mother.
“That’s what comes of being a teetotaller,” he observed in bitter regret.
“The Black Stone,” he repeated.
“The boy’s uncle is down there,” said Jip quietly.
“There’s a terrible heap of silver in it,” he said.
“There’s two chaps below looking for you,” he whispered.
“There’s worse jobs and there’s better,” I said sententiously.
“These were never made by a country shoemaker.” “They were not,” I said readily.
“They could,” he said.
“This bread’s a fine sight, Paul,” said Annie.
“This fellow is all right.” They asked one last question.
“Very well,” replied the mother.
“Walter he!” came the ringing voice.
“Was it as bad as that?” he asked ruefully.
“We have such jolly times,” Miriam said to Clara.
“We mean regular staircases,” I said.
“Well met, my lad!” He got a horrid fright.
“Well, my lad!” he’s eyes were wet.
“Well, you can if you like,” said Fanny.
“We’re on the scent at last,” I cried excitedly.
“What do you want to be?” his mother asked.
“What does it feel like?” I asked.
“What have you been doing all morning?” asked Paul of Miriam.
“What matters it how far we go?” his scaly friend replied.
“What song was that?” asked Miriam.
“What was your job in Rhodesia, Mr Hannay?” he asked.
“What’s my dad eating his snap for now?” asked Arthur.
“What’s that?” I asked.
“Where did you find out this story?” I asked.
“Where is Scudder’s book?” I cried to Sir Walter.
“Who dost reckon this is?” he asked of his wife.
“Who the devil are you?” he gasped.
“Why not?” murmured Miriam huskily.
“Will yer?” he said, quiet and intense.
“Will you oblige me with the story of your recent doings?” he asked.
“Yes and no,” he said.
“Yes,” replied Miriam in her musical tone.
“Yes,” replied Miriam, as she walked at his side.
“You are too hasty, sir,” she cried.
“You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her.
“You can take up your life where you left off,” I was told.
“You may dismiss the police from your mind,” he said.
“You mean Miss Limb?” asked Miriam.
“You seem in a hurry, my friend,” he said slowly.
“Your horse is a fine fellow!” said Clara.
“Your paper woke them up,” he said gleefully.
“You’ll know me next time, guv’nor,” I said.
“You’re the right sort of fellow,” he said.
“You’re young to be an innkeeper,” I said.
“You’ve a fine taste in boots,” he said.
