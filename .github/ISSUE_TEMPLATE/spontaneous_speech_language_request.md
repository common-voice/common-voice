# Welcome to the Common Voice Community!

Thank you for your interest in adding a new language to the Common Voice Spontaneous Speech platform and dataset.

## Necessary metadata

- Language to add to Spontaneous Speech:
- ISO code: <!-- ISO-639-1 (if available) and/or ISO-639-3 -->

<!-- If your language has variants you'd like to add, pleae create an issue from `Add accents or variants` template. -->

## Questions
A list of 60 or more questions in your language that speakers will respond to as they contribute to the Spontaneous Speech dataset. These questions will act as prompts and should allow a speaker to respond to them in roughly 10-25 seconds. These prompts should be culturally appropriate for the language community. These questions should not encourage speakers to share personally identifiable information. 


### How to write good prompts
Writing prompts can be hard at first, to get you started here are some examples of prompts that have been used in other languages include:
- What do people in your community usually do to celebrate birthdays?
- What is your favourite season and why?
- How do you think access to technology is changing the way people connect to each other?

Itâ€™s **very important** to avoid including prompts that could encourage people to share personally identifiable information. Examples of personally identifiable information that speakers should not use in their responses to prompts includes: 
- Names of the speaker, or their family members. 
- Phone numbers, email addresses or physical addresses/locations
- Information about their medical, financial or business information


### What happens next
After the issue is created, we would need at least two other speakers of your language to look through them; unfortunately we can't change the questions once they're in the system.
