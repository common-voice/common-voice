# Welcome to the Common Voice Community !

> Common Voice aims to make speech technology accessible to everyone by building an open sourced dataset of labelled voice data that is representative of languages, variants and accents spoken across the world. This template helps us to know how your language could participate in the Common Voice Project. There are three sections of this form, once you have filled out a section please click the checkbox. If you have any issues please contact <commonvoice@mozilla.org>.

## Pontoon Set-up

> To start a language on Common Voice volunteers localise our platform [via Pontoon](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/projects/common-voice/) and create sentence corpusâ€™ of cc0 text. </p>

## Sentence Collection Requirements

> On the Common Voice Platform contributors on the platform read out public domain sentences generated through sentence collection. Sentence collection is a crucial part in launching languages on Common Voice. To support the equitable participation of languages of Common Voice we have introduced [three new sentence collection requirements bands](https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/share-your-views-nuancing-sentence-collection-requirements-new-sentence-collection-bands/93134).

**Sentence Requirement Band**

<!--- After reading the linked discourse post, please share with us the band the apply's most to your language ?-->

- [ ] Band A

<!--- Starting at 750 Sentences, the language has speaker population less than 1 million, resource self assement is low and langauge vitality is low -->

- [ ] Band B

<!--- Starting at 2000 Sentences, the language has speaker population less than 10 million, resource self assement is medium and langauge vitality is moderate -->

- [ ] Band C

<!--- Starting at 5000 Sentences, the language has speaker population over than 10 million, resource self assement is high and langauge vitality is high-->


## Creating Community 

<!--- How can you start a community ?
- We have created a [community building template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15Kyf3g47HjUCJ55c3aLpvxf96R2cUti2mcRyiyXej90/edit?usp=sharing) to help you think about the goals, objectives and literature to inspire you. 
- Establishing [communication platforms](https://github.com/common-voice/common-voice/blob/main/docs/COMMUNITIES.md) for your language can help to connect volunteers and mobilise people for community campaigns. 
- You can request a language specific channel on [discourse](https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/about-common-voice-readme-first/17218) and or make your own [language matrix](https://app.element.io/#/room/#common-voice:mozilla.org) on the Mozilla instance. 
- [Mozilla Resources Reps](https://community.mozilla.org/en/groups/mozilla-reps-resources/) and [Reward, Enablement and Recognition](https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/recognition-rewards-and-contribution-pathways/84408) Schemes are an avenue for getting support. 
- We also have a [community support desk](https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/introducing-community-support-desk/88158) that happens bi-weekly on Thursday. -->
