# REPORTING.MD
This document provides high-level information, for understanding and reporting violations of Mozilla's Community Participation Guidelines.


[From the Community Participation Guidlines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/)

"*The heart of Mozilla is people. We put people first and do our best to recognize, appreciate and respect the diversity of our global contributors. The Mozilla Project welcomes contributions from everyone who shares our goals and wants to contribute in a healthy and constructive manner within our community. As such, we have adopted this code of conduct and require all those who participate to agree and adhere to these Community Participation Guidelines in order to help us create a safe and positive community experience for all.*"

This document is intended as an interface to existing documents, processes and people responsible for ensuring Mozilla's communities are healthy, and inclusive for all.  

## When To Report

Always report all incidents of:

* Violence and Threats of Violence
* Personal Attacks
* Derogatory Language
* Unwelcome Sexual Attention or Physical Contact
* Influencing Unacceptable Behavior

Please see the [CPG](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/) for full details of each listed above. 

## How to Take a Report

**If you believe someone is in physical danger, consult with a staff member, of volunteer you trust to call your local emergency number.**

### If someone reports to you...

* Do not question, or judge their experience
* Do not invite them to withdraw the incident report
* Do not promise any particular response

*Try to get as much of the incident in written form by the reporter. If you cannot, transcribe it yourself as it was told to you. The important information to gather include the following:*

* Current date and time
* Date and time of the incident
* Location of incident
* Description of the incident
* (If in person) information of the reported person: name, physical appearance, height, clothing, voice accent, identifying badge information.
* (if online) information of the reported person:  name, nickname, communication/chat forum.
* Additional circumstances surrounding the incident
* Reporterâ€™s name and contact information. If the reporter wants to make an anonymous report, allow them to do so. 
* Other people involved in or witnesses to the incident and their contact information or description
* Do not prompt the reporter for suggestions of how to handle the incident, but record their suggested responses if they offer them

**Send Rports to:** [inclusion@mozilla.com](mailto:inclusion@mozilla.com)

**NOTE:** email alias is temporary as we setup a system for response.   The alias currently goes Diversity & Inclusion Leader, Larissa Shapiro, and our Director of Organizational Development, Tyler Haugen. After receiving a concise description of your situation, they will review and determine next steps. In addition to conducting any investigation, they can provide a range of resources, from a private consultation to other community resources. They will involve other colleagues, including legal counsel, only as needed to appropriately address each situation.

Please also report to us if you observe a potentially dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of these guidelines, even if the situation is not happening to you. 

## How to Give a Report

If you have experienced or witnessed a violation of the Community Participation Guidelines, reach out to a trusted staff or volunteer and share this document with them.

## Confidentiality

All reports will be kept confidential. When we discuss incidents with people who are reported, we will anonymize details as much as we can to protect reporter privacy.

However, some incidents happen in one-on-one interactions, and even if the details are anonymized, the reported person may be able to guess who made the report. If you have concerns about retaliation or your personal safety, please note those in your report. We still encourage you to report, so that we can support you while keeping our conference attendees safe. In some cases, we can compile several anonymized reports into a pattern of behavior, and take action on that pattern.

In some cases we may determine that a public statement will need to be made. If that's the case, the identities of all victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.
