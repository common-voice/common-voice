## ABOUT US

about-title = Why Common Voice?
about-header-description-v2 =
    <p>Common Voice is a publicly available voice dataset, powered by the voices of volunteer contributors around the world. People who want to build voice applications can use the dataset to train machine learning models.</p>
    <p>At present, most voice datasets are owned by companies, which stifles innovation. Voice datasets also underrepresent: non-English speakers, people of colour, disabled people, women and LGBTQIA+ people. This means that voice-enabled technology doesn’t work at all for many languages, and where it does work, it may not perform equally well for everyone. We want to change that by mobilising people everywhere to share their voice.</p>
how-does-it-work-title-v2 = How does Common Voice work?
how-does-it-work-text = We’re crowdsourcing an open-source dataset of voices. Donate your voice, validate the accuracy of other people’s clips, make the dataset better for everyone.

## What is a language

about-playbook-what-is-language = What is a language on Common Voice?
about-playbook-what-is-language-content-1 = There are lots of ways to think about language. For the purposes of speech recognition models, Common Voice suggests focussing on ‘mutual intelligibility’, or ‘can speakers of this language mostly understand one another if they try to?’
