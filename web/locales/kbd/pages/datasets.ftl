## Datasets Page

datasets-headline = We’re building an open source, multi-language dataset of voices that anyone can use to train speech-enabled applications.
datasets-positioning =
    We believe that large, publicly available voice datasets will foster innovation and healthy commercial competition in machine-learning based speech technology.
    
    Common Voice’s multi-language dataset is already the largest publicly available voice dataset of its kind, but it’s not the only one.
