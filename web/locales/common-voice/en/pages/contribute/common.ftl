contribution-varying-pronunciations-title = Varying Pronunciations
contribution-varying-pronunciations-description = Be cautious before rejecting a clip on the ground that the reader has mispronounced a word, has put the stress in the wrong place, or has apparently ignored a question mark. There are a wide variety of pronunciations in use around the world, some of which you may not have heard in your local community. Please provide a margin of appreciation for those who may speak differently from you.
contribution-varying-pronunciations-description-extended = On the other hand, if you think that the reader has probably never come across the word before, and is simply making an incorrect guess at the pronunciation, please reject. If you are unsure, use the skip button.

contribution-varying-pronunciations-example-1-explanation = [‘Beret’ is OK whether with stress on the first syllable (UK) or the second (US)]

contribution-background-noise-title = Background Noise
contribution-background-noise-description = We want the machine learning algorithms to able to handle a variety of background noise, and even relatively loud noises can be accepted provided that they don’t prevent you from hearing the entirety of the text.

contribution-background-voices-description = A quiet background hubbub is OK, but we don’t want additional voices that may cause a machine algorithm to identify words that are not in the written text. If you can hear distinct words apart from those of the text, the clip should be rejected. Typically this happens where the TV has been left on, or where there is a conversation going on nearby.
contribution-background-voices-description-extended = If the recording breaks up, or has crackles, reject unless the entirety of the text can still be heard.
contribution-background-voices-example-1-title = The giant dinosaurs of the Triassic. <strong>[read by one voice]</strong>
