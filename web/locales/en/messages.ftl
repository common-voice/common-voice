## FAQ
faq-title = Frequently Asked Questions

faq-what-cv-q = What is Common Voice?
faq-what-cv-a =
    Voice recognition technology is revolutionizing the way we interact with machines, but the currently available systems are expensive and proprietary. Common Voice is part of Mozilla’s initiative to make voice recognition technologies better and more accessible for everyone. Common Voice is a massive global database of donated voices that lets anyone quickly and easily train voice-enabled apps in potentially every language.
faq-what-cv-a-2 =
    Voice recognition technology is revolutionizing the way we interact with machines, but the currently available systems are expensive and proprietary. Mozilla Common Voice is an initiative to make voice recognition technologies better and more accessible for everyone. Common Voice is a massive global database of donated voices that lets anyone quickly and easily train voice-enabled apps in potentially every language.

    We're not only collecting voice samples  in widely spoken languages but also in those with a smaller population of speakers. Publishing a diverse dataset of voices will empower developers, entrepreneurs, and communities to address this gap themselves.

faq-why-important-q = Why is it important?
faq-why-important-a =
    Speech is often the most natural way we communicate with each other and voice technologies are bringing that convenience to our computers and mobile devices. We want to empower developers to build amazing voice recognition applications like real-time translators and voice-enabled digital assistants. But right now most of the voice data required to build these kinds of apps is expensive and proprietary. We hope the Common Voice dataset will give developers what they need to innovate and make speech technology available in their own language.

    To make voice recognition even more universal, we're collecting voice samples in widely spoken languages as well as those with a smaller population of speakers often underserved by commercial speech recognition services. Publishing a diverse dataset of voices will empower developers, entrepreneurs, and entire speech communities to address this gap themselves.

faq-how-get-q = How can I get the Common Voice data?
faq-how-get-a = The Common Voice dataset is available for download under the <licenseLink>CC0</licenseLink> license on <datasetLink>our Datasets page</datasetLink>. You can also download several other publicly available datasets from the same page.

faq-when-release2-q = When will you release Common Voice data in other languages?
faq-when-release2-a = The multi-language version of the Common Voice dataset is currently undergoing community supported bundling and cleaning. If you would like to help us bring Common Voice to new languages, go check out the <sentenceCollectorLink>Sentence Collection Tool</sentenceCollectorLink> for adding new sentences to the dataset, and Mozilla <pontoonLink>Pontoon</pontoonLink> for translating the website itself. New languages are added to Common Voice for voice contribution when 5000 approved sentences have been collected.

faq-why-mission-q = Why is Common Voice part of the Mozilla mission?
faq-why-mission-a = Mozilla is dedicated to keeping the web open and accessible for everyone. To do that we need to empower web creators through projects like Common Voice. As voice technologies proliferate beyond niche applications, we believe they must serve all users equally. That means investing in more languages and accommodating diverse accents and demographics when building and testing voice technologies. Common Voice is a public resource available to everyone and Mozilla teams and developers around the world are already using it on our own projects as well.

faq-what-cv-and-deepspeech-q = What’s the difference between Common Voice and Deep Speech?
faq-what-cv-and-deepspeech-a = The Common Voice dataset complements Mozilla’s open source voice recognition engine Deep Speech. The first version of Deep Speech was released in November 2017 and has continued to evolve ever since. Together with the Common Voice dataset, we believe this open source voice recognition technology should be available to everybody. It’s our hope these technologies will enable developers to build a wave of innovative products and services.

faq-is-goal-assistant-q = Is the goal of Common Voice to build a voice assistant?
faq-is-goal-assistant-a = The goal of the Common Voice dataset is to enable anyone in the world to build speech recognition, speaker recognition, or any other type of application that requires voice data. A voice assistant is just one of many types of applications you could use the dataset to build.

faq-do-want-native-q = I am a non-native speaker and I speak with an accent, do you still want my voice?
faq-do-want-native-a = Yes, we especially want your voice! Part of the aim of Common Voice is to gather as many different accents as possible so that voice recognition services work equally well for everyone. This means donations from non-native speakers are particularly important.

faq-why-different-speakers-q = Why do you need so many different speakers per language?
faq-why-different-speakers-a =
    Most speech databases are trained with an overrepresentation of certain demographics which results in a bias towards <articleLink>male and middle class</articleLink>. Accents and dialects that tend to be under-represented in training data sets are typically associated with groups of people who are already marginalised. Many machines also struggle to understand female voices.
    This is why in our voice database we want variety!

faq-why-my-lang-q = Why is my language not included yet?
faq-why-my-lang-a =
    Common Voice is a crowdsourcing platform, and the languages were all added by volunteers.
    We would love for you to add your language! <languageRequestLink>Ask about adding your language.</languageRequestLink>

faq-what-quality-q = What level of audio quality is required for a voice clip to be used in the dataset?
faq-what-quality-a = We want the Common Voice dataset to reflect the audio quality a speech-to-text engine will hear in the wild, so we’re looking for variety. In addition to a diverse community of speakers, a dataset with varying audio quality will teach the speech-to-text engine to handle various real-world situations, from background talking to car noise. As long as your voice clip is intelligible, it should be good enough for the dataset.

faq-why-10k-hours-q = Why is 10,000 validated hours the per language goal for capturing audio?
faq-why-10k-hours-a = This is approximately the number of hours required to train a production speech-to-text system.

faq-how-calc-hours-q = How does Common Voice calculate hours?
faq-how-calc-hours-a = We calculate hours by estimating the average length of each recording, and then multiplying that number by the total number of recordings across all languages.

faq-where-src-from-2-q = Where does the source text come from?
faq-where-src-from-2-a =
    Our source text is made up of original contributor donations as well as dialogue from public domain movie scripts like <italic>It’s a Wonderful Life</italic>.

    You can view our source sentences in this <githubLink>GitHub folder</githubLink>.

faq-why-not-ask-read-q = Why don’t you ask people to read from books or Wikipedia articles in different languages?
faq-why-not-ask-read-a = To make the Common Voice dataset as useful as possible we have decided to only allow source text that is available under a Creative Commons (CC0) license. Using the CC0 standard means its more difficult to find and collect source text, but allows anyone to use the resulting voice data without usage restrictions or authorization from Mozilla. Ultimately, we want to make the multi-language dataset as useful as possible to everyone, including researchers, universities, startups, governments, social purpose organizations, and hobbyists.

faq-why-account-q = Why should I sign up for an account?
faq-is-account-public-q = Is my account information public?

faq-how-privacy-q = How do you ensure anonymity and privacy of the people who donated their voices?
faq-how-privacy-a = All voice clips in the dataset are scrubbed of personally identifying information. When a contributor provides demographic data via their profile, that information is de-identified from their voice clips before being bundled for download in the dataset and is never made public on their profile page.

faq-what-determine-identity-q = What does it mean that I can’t “determine the identity” of speakers in the Common Voice dataset?
faq-what-determine-identity-a =
    The Common Voice dataset is an open and publicly available resource that can be used to train a wide variety of speech-enabled applications. To protect the security of our contributors, we ask everyone who downloads the Common Voice dataset to respect contributors’ privacy.

    All voice clips in the dataset are scrubbed of personally identifying information. When you download the dataset, you agree to not attempt to determine the identity of any contributor. That means you cannot try to link information in the dataset to a contributor’s personal information. You may, however, use the dataset to train speech recognition, speaker recognition, or other applications, by, for instance, linking information in the dataset to other information already in the dataset.

faq-what-is-cv = What is Common Voice?
faq-using-cv = Using Common Voice
faq-description = Common Voice is part of Mozilla's initiative to help teach machines how real people speak.
faq-search-for-answers =
    .label = Search for answers

## ABOUT US
about-title = Why Common Voice?
about-header-description-v2 = <p>Common Voice is a publicly available voice dataset, powered by the voices of volunteer contributors around the world. People who want to build voice applications can use the dataset to train machine learning models.</p>
    <p>At present, most voice datasets are owned by companies, which stifles innovation. Voice datasets also underrepresent: non-English speakers, people of colour, disabled people, women and LGBTQIA+ people. This means that voice-enabled technology doesn’t work at all for many languages, and where it does work, it may not perform equally well for everyone. We want to change that by mobilising people everywhere to share their voice.</p>

Please provide a margin of appreciation for those who may speak differently from you.
contribution-varying-pronunciations-description-extended = On the other hand, if you think that the reader has probably never come across the word before, and is simply making an incorrect guess at the pronunciation, please reject. If you are unsure, use the skip button.

If you can hear distinct words apart from those of the text, the clip should be rejected. Typically this happens where the TV has been left on, or where there is a conversation going on nearby.
contribution-background-voices-description-extended = If the recording breaks up, or has crackles, reject unless the entirety of the text can still be heard.

## HOW-TO
sc-howto-title = How to
sc-howto-addlang-title = Adding languages to work with
sc-howto-addlang-text = Once logged in you can select your languages from the profile section.
sc-howto-addsen-title = Add new sentences
sc-howto-addsen-item-1 = All sentences you submit must be under <wikipediaLink>Public Domain (CC-0) license</wikipediaLink>. To support the inclusion of work not under public licence, we have created a <cc0WaiverLink>Contributions Agreement template</cc0WaiverLink> for works where the copyright owner would like to contribute the material to Common Voice.
sc-howto-addsen-item-2 = Numbers. There should be no digits in the source text because they can cause problems when read aloud. The way a number is read depends on context and might introduce confusion in the dataset. For example, the number “2409” could be accurately read as both “twenty-four zero nine” and “two thousand four hundred nine”.
sc-howto-addsen-item-3 = Abbreviations and Acronyms. Abbreviations and acronyms like “USA” or “ICE” should be avoided in the source text because they may be read in a way that does not coincide with their spelling. Additionally, there may be multiple accurate readings for a single abbreviation. For example, the acronym “ICE” could be pronounced “I-C-E” or as a single word.
sc-howto-addsen-item-4 = Punctuation. Special symbols and punctuation should only be included when absolutely necessary. For example, an apostrophe is included in English words like “don’t” and “we’re” and should be included in the source text, but it’s unlikely you’ll ever need a special symbol like “@” or “#.”
sc-howto-addsen-item-5 = Foreign letters. Letters must be valid in the language being spoken. For example, “ж” is a letter in the Russian alphabet but is never used in English and so should never appear in any English source text.
sc-howto-addsen-item-6 = Languages can have their <validationRulesLink>own validation rules</validationRulesLink> with additional requirements. If there is no specific validation file for a language, we are using the generic English rules.
sc-howto-addsen-post-1 = We prefer natural/conversational sentences. While phonetic diversity and different words in sentences is important, we are trying to make recording sentences as much fun as possible. Therefore it would be great if you could try to keep your sentences as natural/engaging as possible.
sc-howto-cite-title = How to Cite
sc-howto-cite-pre-1 = It's important that you reference where you found the public licence to avoid plagiarism and to allow for follow ups on <copyrightIssuesLink>copyright issues</copyrightIssuesLink>. Here are a few ways you can cite the work.
sc-howto-cite-item-1 = You could include the website, e.g "Common Voice - https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/"
sc-howto-cite-item-2 = You could use academic referencing style, e.g Harvard style "Mozilla (2021) Common Voice. Available at https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/ (Accessed: 15th September 2021)"
sc-howto-cite-item-3 = For public domain text not available online, you could use academic referencing style e.g Harvard style "Jess (2021) My Public licence poems"
sc-howto-review-title = Review Sentences
sc-howto-review-subtitle = Make sure the sentence meets the following criteria:
sc-howto-review-criteria-1 = The sentence must be spelled correctly.

sc-howto-review-criteria-6 = If you run out of sentences to review, please help us collect more sentences!
sc-howto-findpd-title = Finding existing sentences in the Public Domain
sc-howto-findpd-subtitle = Search for them on the Internet
sc-howto-findpd-text-2 = Remember that we need permission to publish those sentences, so always ensure that the text belongs to the <wikipediaLink>public domain</wikipediaLink>. If there is no explicit indication, reach out to the person that the text belongs to and ask if they want to contribute their text to the Public Domain. If they want to, help them go through the <cc0WaiverLink>Contributions Agreement</cc0WaiverLink> process. If they do not want to contribute the text, then you are not allowed to use that text.
sc-howto-findpd-tips = Here are some tips to find sentences:
sc-howto-findpd-tips-1 = The best sources you can look for are podcasts, transcripts, movie scripts and anything that potential can contain everyday conversations.
sc-howto-findpd-tips-2 = Government proceedings, books and articles are also great however since the text tends to be a little more formal they are less of a priority.
sc-howto-findpd-tips-3 = Unfortunately we can’t have Wikimedia articles yet. So do not copy paste from there.
sc-howto-findpd-subtitle-2 = Partner with local organizations or individuals
sc-howto-findpd-partner-1 = There are a lot of public organizations that might want to collaborate and already have a lot of texts they can donate as public domain. Reach out to local universities, Governments and open source organizations to talk about the project and ask for their help.
sc-howto-findpd-partner-2 = Expert linguists can also help, try to reach out to local linguistic universities (both teachers and students) and see if they can help to gather a diverse set of sound-diverse sentences in your language.

# GUIDELINES PAGE
guidelines-header = Contribution Guidelines
guidelines-header-subtitle = Understand how to contribute and validate sentences and audio clips to the Common Voice dataset
voice-collection = Voice Collection
sentence-collection = Sentence Collection
varying-pronunciations = Varying Pronunciations
misreadings = Misreadings
offensive-content = Offensive Content
background-noise = Background Noise
background-voices = Background Voices
volume = Volume
reader-effects = Reader Effects
just-unsure = Just Unsure?
example = Example
varying-pronunciations-explanation-1 = We welcome different accents! Be very cautious before rejecting a clip on the ground that you think the reader has mispronounced a word, has put the stress in the wrong place, or has ignored punctuation. There are a wide variety of pronunciations in use around the world, some of which you may not have heard in your local community. Please provide a generous margin of appreciation for those who may speak differently from you.
varying-pronunciations-explanation-2 = On the other hand, if you think that the reader has never come across the word before, and is making an incorrect guess at the pronunciation, please reject. If you are unsure, use the skip button.
varying-pronunciations-example = The route was unclear.
varying-pronunciations-tip-1 = [Canadian English might make "route" sound like "rowt"]
varying-pronunciations-tip-2 = [British English might make "root"]
offensive-content-explanation = Sentences are vetted through a community-moderation process, however this process is not perfect. If you see or hear a sentence that offends or upsets you - for example because it violates our <participationGuidelines>community participation guidelines</participationGuidelines> - please do use the flag button in the UI. You can also reach out to us at <emailFragment>commonvoice@mozilla.com</emailFragment>.
misreadings-explanation-1 = Reading all the words on the page correctly does matter. When listening, check very carefully that what has been recorded is exactly what has been written; reject if they have added, contracted or missed words.
misreadings-explanation-2 = Very common mistakes include:
misreadings-explanation-3 = Missing 'A' or 'The' at the beginning of the recording.
misreadings-explanation-4 = Missing an 's' at the end of a word.
misreadings-explanation-5 = Reading contractions that aren't actually there, such as "We're" instead of "We are", or vice versa.
misreadings-explanation-6 = Missing the end of the last word by cutting off the recording too quickly.
misreadings-explanation-7 = Taking several attempts to read a word.

misreadings-tip-2 = [No ‘a’ in the original text]
misreadings-tip-3 = [Mismatched content]
background-noise-explanation = You need to be able to hear every word of the recording. We want machine learning algorithms to be able to handle a variety of background noise, and even relatively loud noises or quiet background music can be accepted provided that they don’t prevent you from hearing the entirety of the text. Crackles or ‘breaking up’ that prevent you hearing the text means you should reject the clip.
background-noise-example-1 = The giant dinosaurs of the Triassic.
background-noise-example-2 = [Sneeze] The giant dinosaurs of the [cough] Triassic.
background-noise-example-3 = The giant dino [cough] the Triassic.

background-noise-tip-1 = [interrupted by background noise]
background-noise-tip-2 = [Part of the text can’t be heard]
background-voices-explanation = A little background noise is okay, but if you can hear another person speaking distinct words, the clip should be rejected. Typically this happens where the TV has been left on, or where there is a conversation going on nearby.
background-voices-example-1 = The giant dinosaurs of the Triassic. [read by one voice]
background-voices-tip-1 = Are you coming? [called by another]
volume-explanation = There will be natural variations in volume between readers. Reject only if the volume is so high that the recording breaks up, or (more commonly) if it is so low that you can’t hear what is being said without reference to the written text.
reader-effects-explanation = Most recordings are of people talking in their natural voice. You can accept the occasional non-standard recording that is shouted, whispered, or obviously delivered in a ‘dramatic’ voice. Please reject sung recordings and those using a computer-synthesized voice.
just-unsure-explanation = If you come across something that these guidelines don’t cover, please vote according to your best judgement. If you really can’t decide, use the skip button and go on to the next recording.

public-domain = Public Domain
citing-sentences = Citing Sentences
adding-sentences = Adding Sentences
reviewing-sentences = Reviewing Sentences
sentence-domain = Sentence Domain
public-domain-explanation-1 = It is very important that all text sentences are <publicDomain>public domain</publicDomain> (<cc0>cc0</cc0>) as the Common Voice dataset is released under a cc0 license. Only ever upload a sentence if you are sure, and always include the relevant citation.
public-domain-explanation-2 = The best sentences for building a useful speech recognition engine are colloquial, modern parlance. Some ideas to help you generate sentences are;
public-domain-explanation-3 = Create modern, colloquial sentences by yourself or with your friends or language community - for example through a ‘write-a-thon’
public-domain-explanation-4 = Contact authors, playwrights or screenwriters and ask if they would be willing to dedicate a small portion of their works to the public domain
public-domain-explanation-5 = Look for text where the copyright no longer applies - for example most books that were published before 1920

adding-sentences-subheader-speakable-explanation = The best sentences are natural and conversational — they should be easy for someone to read. While phonetic diversity and different words in sentences is important, we are also trying to make recording sentences as engaging and fun for our volunteer community as possible.
adding-sentences-subheader-numbers = Numbers
adding-sentences-subheader-numbers-explanation = There should ideally be no digits in the source text because they can cause problems when read aloud. The way a number is read depends on context and might introduce confusion in the dataset. For example, the number “2409” could be accurately read as both “twenty-four zero nine” and “two thousand four hundred nine”.
adding-sentences-subheader-abbreviations = Abbreviations and Acronyms
adding-sentences-subheader-abbreviations-explanation = Abbreviations and acronyms like “USA” or “ICE” should be avoided in the source text because they may be read in a way that does not coincide with their spelling. Additionally, there may be multiple accurate readings for a single abbreviation.
adding-sentences-subheader-punctuation = Punctuation
adding-sentences-subheader-punctuation-explanation = Special symbols and punctuation should only be included when absolutely necessary. For example, an apostrophe is included in English words like “don’t” and “we’re” and should be included in the source text, but it’s unlikely you’ll ever need a special symbol like “@” or “#.”
adding-sentences-subheader-special-characters = Special Characters and Foreign Letters
adding-sentences-subheader-special-characters-explanation-1 = Letters must be valid in the language being spoken. For example, “ж” is a letter in the Russian alphabet but is never used in English and so should never appear in any English source text.
adding-sentences-subheader-special-characters-explanation-2 = Languages can have their own validation rules with additional requirements when they localize. If there is no specific validation file for a language, the English rules will show for contributors.
adding-sentences-subheader-offensive-content = Offensive Content
adding-sentences-subheader-offensive-content-explanation = If the sentence is offensive or upsetting - for example because of explicit content, or another violation of our <communityGuidelines>community participation guidelines</communityGuidelines> - you should reject the sentence. You can also reach out to us at <emailFragment>commonvoice@mozilla.com</emailFragment> to escalate the issue.
reviewing-sentences-explanation-1 = If the sentence meets the criteria above, click the "Yes" button.
reviewing-sentences-explanation-2 = If the sentence does not meet the above criteria, click the "No" button.
