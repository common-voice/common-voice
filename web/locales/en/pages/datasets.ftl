datasets-positioning =
    We believe that large, publicly available voice datasets will foster innovation and healthy commercial competition in machine-learning based speech technology.
    
    Common Voice’s multi-language dataset is already the largest publicly available voice dataset of its kind, but it’s not the only one.
    
    Look to this page as a reference hub for other open source voice datasets and, as Common Voice continues to grow, a home for our release updates.

    The dataset currently consists of <b>{ $valid }</b> validated hours in <b>{ $languages }</b> languages, but we’re always adding more voices and languages. Take a look at our <languagesLink>Languages page</languagesLink> to request a language or start contributing.
