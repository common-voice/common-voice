## Datasets Page
datasets-heading = Datasets
datasets-headline = We’re building an open source, multi-language dataset of voices that anyone can use to train speech-enabled applications.
datasets-positioning =
    We believe that large, publicly available voice datasets will foster innovation and healthy commercial competition in machine-learning based speech technology.

    Common Voice’s multi-language dataset is already the largest publicly available voice dataset of its kind, but it’s not the only one.

    Look to this page as a reference hub for other open source voice datasets and, as Common Voice continues to grow, a home for our release updates.

        Each entry in the dataset consists of a unique MP3 and corresponding text file. Many of the <b>{ $total }</b> recorded hours in the dataset also include demographic metadata like age, sex, and accent that can help train the accuracy of speech recognition engines.

        The dataset currently consists of <b>{ $valid }</b> validated hours in <b>{ $languages }</b> languages, but we’re always adding more voices and languages. Take a look at our <languagesLink>Languages page</languagesLink> to request a language or start contributing.
