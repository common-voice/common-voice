    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Project Common Voice is brought to you by Mozilla,
      the proudly non-profit champions of the Internet.</p>

    <p>Today's technologies that allow learning from data are
      freely available for anyone to use, and are resulting a wave
      of innovation online. However, voice technologies (for example,
      speech recognition) are not seeing the same innovation because
      little data is freely available to train machine learning technologies.
      The data that is available is from a set of speakers with limited
      diversity of accents and languages.</p>

    <p>Our aim with Project Common Voice is to enable "voice donors"
      to build the world's largest and most diverse set of voice data
      that is freely available for anyone to use. Our vision is that
      researchers and others will be able to use this data to increase
      innovation in voice related technologies. This will help everyone
      have access to a new wave of voice technologies, and ensure that
      people aren't locked-in to using services from a small number of
      Internet giants.</p>
