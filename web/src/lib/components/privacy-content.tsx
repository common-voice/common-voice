        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Demographic data.</b>You can optionally send us information such
            as your accent, age, and gender. This helps us and other researchers
            improve and create speech-to-text technology and tools.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Account data.</b>You can optionally create an account, in which
            case we receive your email address. This is associated with your
            demographic and interaction data but is not shared to the public.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Voice Recordings.</b>Voice recordings, along with any associated
            demographic data, may be available in the Common Voice database for
            public consumption and use.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Interaction data.</b>We use Google Analytics to better understand
            how you interact with the Common Voice app or website. For example,
            this includes number of voice samples you record or listen to,
            interactions with buttons and menus, session length.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Technical data.</b>Using Google Analytics, we collect the URL and
            title of the Common Voice pages you visit. We collect your browser,
            viewport size, and screen resolution. We also collect your location,
            and the language setting in your browser.
